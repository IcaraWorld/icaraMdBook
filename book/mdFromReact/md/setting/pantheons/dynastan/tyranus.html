<h2 id="titles"><a class="header" href="#titles">Titles</a></h2>
<p>God of Purification, God of Purity, God of Burning Light, Hand of the Emperor</p>
<h2 id="ethos"><a class="header" href="#ethos">Ethos</a></h2>
<p>Tyranus is a Dynastan god whose primary tenants seem to be the extermination of the undead. The God of Purity focuses much attention on the suppression of the dark art of necromancy, and the destruction of the creatures created by it. The disciples of Tyranus are tireless in their pursuit of the undead, and crusades to destroy them can be called by any priest of Tyranus.</p>
<h2 id="worship"><a class="header" href="#worship">Worship</a></h2>
<p>Tyranus has, by far, the most formalized of the Dynastan religion, with temples of worship, written doctrine, and active preaching and conversion taking place within his faith. Tyranus seeks to convert many potent warriors and mages to his ranks for the fight against the living dead, but also converts non-believers simply to provide structure and moral framework to the benefit of society. Of all the fathers of the Dynastan Empire, Tyranus more than most saw the benefit of of a society living not just by laws, but by moral codes as well. As such, what marriage, funeral, and birth rites exist in Dynastan society were created by the religion of Tyranus. Family histories and lineage, now such an integral part of Dynastan culture, are kept because of Tyranus, and are still officially recorded only by priests of the god, though most noble families of any size include a few members of the priesthood who keep the family records.</p>
<p>Tyranus is the one Dynastan god who attracts worshippers of non-Dynastan frequently, as well. No priest is quite so prepared to deal with undeath as those who wield the holy weapons of Tyranus. For this reason, a number of non-Dynastan shrines have sprung up, though the non-Dynastan shrines tend to be focused on only the destruction of the undead, and are more cultish in nature, lacking the scribes and priesthood that Dynastan temples have built up to deal with all the other spiritual needs of the Dynastan people.</p>

<h2 id="history"><a class="header" href="#history">History</a></h2>
<p>Tyranus was a peer of Draken. The highest clergy of his priesthood and few others know the true and terrible history of the Dynastan people, a history that is considered shameful and therefore never taught to the common people, but handed down from high priest to high priest. That truth is that the Dynastan themselves were created by foul necromancy at the hands of a dracolich of unfathomable strength and power. This creature wished to subjugate the world, and through blood sacrifice manipulated the life-force of enslaved dragons, ushering into being a new race of warriors. These warriors he bred and trained to fight for him, and each from birth was bound with blood to serve him. Draken and Tyranus themselves were the greatest achievements of this loathsome army, two beings so steeped in the ancient arcane power and unbridled ferocity of the great wyrms that they were near invincible. At hte head of an army of death that swept life clean everywhere it marched just as the Age of Apocalypse was coming to a close, they harvested souls for the unquenchable thirst of their skeletal god as he traveled with them in gathering the blood sacrifices it desired for its attempt to become a true god.</p>
<p>It was during just such an extermination, the genocide of a great sun elven city, that the Sun magic of the elves allowed Draken to gather his own identity from deep within its necromantic hold, as they tried to burn and dispel the unstoppable reaper that Draken was. That blazing shock of divine pain-inspired freedom allowed Draken to betray his master, and using his knowledge of his dark master's secrets, to destroy the creature utterly.</p>
<p>With the dark necromancer gone, the bonds of the Dynastan people were shattered. Tyranus and Draken, the leaders for so long, set out to create a new life for themselves and their people, with the aid of the Sun Elves, in whom they found ready allies in their attempt to create some good from the evil that had been wrought by their hands. The bitter secret of their creation died with that generation of Dynastan, carried with them to their grave, but the hatred of foul necromancy and the creatures wrought of it was passed on to each new hatchling. Draken and Tyranus organized their society so that it would ever be strong, but would always carry with it that burning brand of hatred, lest another find a way to subvert them once more. So it was that Draken was made Emperor of the newly crafted empire, and Tyranus was made its high priest, creating a religion which was never intended to have a god. Tyranus lived long after Draken had already ascended, but in the twilight of life, the empire stable and complete, he disappeared. Common Dynastan think he ascended then to grant power to his created church, but the high clergy know that he had set out to consecrate the birthing grounds of the Dynastan where he had been created so many years before. Tyranus himself hated gods, since the only thing he had ever known to claim godhood was the black and wicked undead wyrm that had crafted him as a weapon. No one knows what took place at that ancient birthing ground, or even where that unholy site was. What the priests do know is that the man they had worshipped even as a mortal appeared to give them divine strength in their holy war. Speaking praises to the mortal and whispering prayers to the god was an easy transition.</p>
<p>What scholars know is very different, simply that Tyranus was Draken's right hand in forging the Empire. They know he created the church that eventually became his religion as a tool of education and stability to the empire, and that there is a strict hierarchy in place in all aspects of the Empire.</p>
