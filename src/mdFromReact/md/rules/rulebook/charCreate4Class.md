# Class - Adventuring Archetypes

## Barbarian

### Class Overview

Barbarians are a tanky martial class that can absorb a lot of damage and specialize in high damage numbers, trading that off with inconsistency. Big crits, high damage attacks, fewer attacks as a result. They don’t have the best armor class or defensive skills, instead relying on their HP pool and resistances to weather fights.

- **Stats** - Barbarians stat prioritization will generally be Strength/Constitution > Wisdom/Dexterity > Intelligence/Charisma. 
- **Class Type** - Barbarians are a martial class, but they do not get full attack increase progression, instead relying on crits and damage bonuses to deal their damage. 
- **Key Gameplay Mechanics: **
    - **Rage:** Barbarians fly into rages to fuel most of their class skills. Rages increase their damage through bonus damage and increased crit chance, and their defense through improved resistances to damage. They use Stamina to fuel these rages, and are the only class to rapidly regain Stamina as part of their core class mechanic.
    - **Bonus Action Mechanic:** By Subclass 
- **Resources:**
    - **Stamina** - Barbarians primarily use Stamina to fuel their rages. Since they have high constitution pools and regenerate their stamina daily in a way other classes don’t, they can generally get away with dipping lower than most classes would prefer.
    - **Vigor** - Barbarians use vigor for some class abilities and some archetypes use it for shape shifting.

### Essence Binder
Essence Binders use their magic to create or control powerful allies that help them on the battlefield. Using their hex, they empower these allies and force them to do their bidding.

**Examples:** Artificers who create golems or inanimate beasts, necromancers who control undead minions or brutes, or the warlock who would control a devil or a demon all fall into this category. 

Basics:

- This warlock places his hex on a minion to make it stronger or gain control of it in a more permanent way. Unlike traditional summoning spells, this will give the warlock complete control over a minion he can summon or create, at the cost of his bonus action and his hex. If his hex is not placed on a minion, it can be used as he pleases.

### Harbringer

Harbringers are agents of vengeance and woe trained to inflict death and misery on a specific enemy. Unlike many warlocks, they will fight toe to toe with their enemies, and they have mastered powerful curses and deadly weapons with which to do so.

Basics:

- This warlock uses weapons that are magical only in their hands to strike their enemies.
- They also use an enhanced hex called a Malediction , which hampers their enemies in multiple ways, relying on a "reverse bardic inspiration" style die that causes the target extra damage not only once per round but once per each source of damage the warlock hits them with. It can also be used to:
    - reduce targets movement (by dice x 5 in feet) if they are moving away from the warlock (as a reaction)
    - hamper targets attacks if they are attacking the warlock or in melee with the warlock (as a reaction)
    - penalize targets saving throws against the warlock's spells. (as a reaction)
    - add additional damage to any source of damage to the target. (as a reaction.)
- Potentially allow them to "Doom Clock" an enemy, where once they have damaged their target with the Malediction, they can deal the hex damage as a bonus action without requiring an additional attack or roll to hit. This would count as their "once per round" Malediction action. 

### Hex Master

The Hex Master is a master of the magics that they know, and can use multiple hexes. In addition, they can use these hexes to impact multiple targets with their magics.

## Wizard

### Archmage
Archmages focus strongly on mastering a school or set of schools of magic. They tend to get special bonuses when casting spells from that specific school, depending on which one they choose.  

**Suggested Schools** Necromancers, Conjurers, Transmuters are all good fits for Binders.
