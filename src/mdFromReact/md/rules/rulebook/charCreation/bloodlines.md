This page will explain how bloodlines/races work. Currently, these are using a rebalanced version of the 5.24 species, with added/updated rules as needed.

# Eberron Bloodlines

## Changeling

Clever shapeshifters that can impersonate other people and drift through Eberron as a people apart. Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.

### Traits

Trait List:

- **Associated Stats.** Changelings tend to have high charisma, but are equally likely to be skilled in any other area.
- **Associated Dragonmarks.** Changelings cannot have dragonmarks, though they often pretend to.
- **Creature Type.** Humanoid
- **Size.** Medium
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Shapechanger.** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of
  limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.
- **TODO Trait.** Changelings should get one additional minor trait. Potentially let them grow small or large. This might also be a racial feat.
