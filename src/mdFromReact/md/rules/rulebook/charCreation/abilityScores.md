## Eberron Ability Scores

For Eberron, we used "Community Array" - rolling statistics collectively, (all the players rolled 3d6 twice, and we took the top six of them).

**Community Array:** 17 : 15 : 13 : 13 : 11 : 9
**Uncapped Stats:** Caps are uncapped, and can go beyond 20.
**Lvl 0 HP Adjustment:** At level 0, HP is equal to your **constitution score**. Hp advances as normal for classes after that.
