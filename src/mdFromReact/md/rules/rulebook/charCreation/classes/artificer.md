### LEVEL 1: MAGICAL TINKERING
As a Magic action while	holding	Tinker’s Tools,	you	can	create one item in an unoccupied space within 5	feet of yourself, choosing a low cost item. Item's available can be made from nearly nothing, but after an hour it falls apart. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all uses on a Long Rest. 

### LEVEL 1: SPELLCASTING
You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer spell list later in the class’s description.

**Tools Required.** You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves’ Tools, Tinker’s Tools, or another kind of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an “M” component when you cast it).

**Cantrips.** You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

### LEVEL 2: IMPROVISED ENHANCEMENT
You are skilled in quickly creating small mechanical devices, potions, or runes that can be used to improve the effectiveness of...almost anything.

As a Bonus Action, the artificer can craft and deploy an effect booster to a single target within 15'. At the time it is deployed, they can designate it as an boost to weapon damage, spell damage, healing, damage reduction, or any other instance of dice being rolled for effect, not resolution. (It does not impact d20 tests or d100 randomizers). 

This effect increases at the artificer levels:
- 1-8 - 1d6
- 9-16 - 2d6
- 17+ - 3d6

If the effect is not used for the intended purpose before the start of the artificer's next turn, it ends.

### LEVEL 2: REPLICATE MAGIC ITEM
You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.

**Plans Known.** When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the items’ descriptions). Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage +1 are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.

You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table.

**Creating an Item.** When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.

If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement. When you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.

If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.

**Duration.** A magic item created by this feature functions exactly like the normal magic item except its magic isn’t permanent. When you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### LEVEL 3: ARTIFICER SUBCLASS
You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. The Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, and Battle Smith subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.

### LEVEL 3: RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
The list of items you can create with Magical Tinkering now includes Artisan’s Tools, which are described in the Player’s Handbook.

### LEVEL 4: ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.

### LEVEL 6: MAGIC ITEM TINKER
Your Replicate Magic Item feature improves as follows:

**Drain Magic Item.** As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

**Expanded Replication.** When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 6+) table.

### LEVEL 7: FLASH OF GENIUS
When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to add a bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### LEVEL 10: MAGIC ITEM ADEPT
You’ve achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items, granting you the following benefits:

**Additional Attunement.** You can attune to up to four magic items at once rather than three.

**Expanded Replication.** When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 10+) table.

### LEVEL 11: SPELL-STORING ITEM
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a Spellcasting Focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1, 2, or 3 Artificer spell that has a casting time of an action (you needn’t have the spell prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### LEVEL 14: MAGIC ITEM SAVANT
Your skill with magic items deepens, granting you the following benefits:

**Additional Attunement.** You can attune to up to five magic items at once rather than three.

**Expanded Replication.** When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 14+) table. You can have no more than three Rare items created by Replicate Magic Item at a time.

### LEVEL 18: MAGIC ITEM MASTER
You can now attune to up to six magic items at once rather than three.

### LEVEL 19: EPIC BOON
You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Energy Resistance is recommended.

### LEVEL 20: SOUL OF ARTIFICE
You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for aid. You gain the following benefits:

**Cheat Death.** If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can disintegrate one Uncommon or Rare magic item created by your Replicate Magic Item feature, changing your Hit Points to 20 instead of 0.

**Magical Guidance.** While you have Attunement to at least one magic item, you can add 1d6 to any ability check you make. You decide to add the die after rolling the d20, and you can use this benefit only once per turn.

### ARTIFICER SPELL LIST
This section presents the Artificer spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a specific Material component.

## ARTIFICER SUBCLASSES
An Artificer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, and Battle Smith.

### ARTILLERIST
Wield Destructive Power from Afar

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. 

### LEVEL 3: TOOL PROFICIENCY
You gain proficiency with Woodcarver’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice. In addition, when you craft a magic Wand, the amount of time required to craft it is halved.

### LEVEL 3: ARTILLERIST SPELLS
When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Artillerist Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### ARTILLERIST SPELLS

| Artificer Level | Spells   |
|:--|:--|
| 3 | Shield, Thunderwave |
| 5 | Scorching Ray, Shatter |
| 9 | Fireball, Wind Wall |
| 13 | Ice Storm, Wall of Fire |
| 17 | Cone of Cold, Wall of Force |

### LEVEL 3: ELDRITCH CANNON
Using Woodcarver’s Tools or Smith’s Tools, you can take a Magic action to create a Small or Tiny Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of yourself. The cannon’s game statistics appear below. You determine its appearance, which includes your choice of legs or wheels. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as a Magic action.

Once you create a cannon, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can’t create one while your cannon is present.

**ELDRITCH CANNON**
**Small or Tiny Object**

- **Armor Class:** 18
- **Hit Points:** 5 × your Artificer level (casting Mending on the cannon restores 2d6 Hit Points to it)
- **Immunities:** Poison, Psychic

**Activate Cannon** (Requires You to be within 60 Feet of the Cannon). As a Bonus Action, you order the cannon to use the Flamethrower, Force Ballista, or Protector option below; you can direct the cannon to move up to 15 feet before or after that option:

- **Flamethrower.** The cannon exhales fire in a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or carried start burning.
- **Force Ballista.** Make a ranged spell attack originating from the cannon at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 Force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.
- **Protector.** The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

### LEVEL 5: ARCANE FIREARM
When you finish a Long Rest, you can use Woodcarver’s Tools to carve special sigils into a Rod, Staff, or Wand and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely. You can use your arcane firearm as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. When you cast an Artificer spell through the firearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell’s damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

### LEVEL 9: EXPLOSIVE CANNON
Every Eldritch Cannon you create is now more destructive. You gain the following benefits:

- **Detonate.** When your cannon is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Firepower.** The cannon’s damage rolls increase by 1d8.

### LEVEL 15: FORTIFIED POSITION
You’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon. You gain the following benefits:

- **Double Firepower.** You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same Magic action (but not with the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action, ordering them to use the same activation option or different ones. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two.
- **Shimmering Field Projection.** You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10 feet of your Eldritch Cannon.
