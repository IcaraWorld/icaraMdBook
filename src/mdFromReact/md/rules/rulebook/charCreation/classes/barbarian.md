# Barbarian

<!-- toc -->

## Class Overview

Barbarians are a tanky martial class that can absorb a lot of damage and specialize in high damage numbers, trading that off with inconsistency. Big crits, high damage attacks, fewer attacks as a result. They don’t have the best armor class or defensive skills, instead relying on their HP pool and resistances to weather fights.

- **Stats:** - Barbarians stat prioritization will generally be Strength/Constitution > Wisdom/Dexterity > Intelligence/Charisma. 
- **Class Type:** - Barbarians are a martial class, but they do not get full attack increase progression, instead relying on crits and damage bonuses to deal their damage. 
- **Key Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - **Rage** - Barbarians fly into rages to fuel most of their class skills. Rages increase their damage through bonus damage and increased crit chance, and their defense through improved resistances to damage. They use Stamina to fuel these rages, and are the only class to rapidly regain Stamina as part of their core class mechanic.
    - **Bonus Action Mechanic:** By Archtype
- **Resources:**
    - **Stamina** - Barbarians primarily use Stamina to fuel their rages. Since they have high constitution pools and regenerate their stamina daily in a way other classes don’t, they can generally get away with dipping lower than most classes would prefer.
    - **Vigor** - Barbarians use vigor for some class abilities and some archetypes use it for shape shifting.

### Class Features



## Berserker 

Berserkers use massive weapons and a reckless fighting style to deal massive amounts of damage. They tend to have the highest passive damage of all barbarian archtypes.

### Archtype Features

Giant Weapons: The berserker uses larger weapon sizes than normal, dealing increased damage dice.
Bonus Action Attack: Berserkers can use an extra attack as a bonus action as part of their frenzy. 

## Totem Barbarian

Totem Barbarians are tied to the spirits of nature, choosing from a selection of totemic animal spirits that represent their tribe. They can shapeshift into the chosen animal, and the beast gets stronger as they level. In addition to the additional tankiness from the added hit point pool, each totem beast will have some form of utility the barbarian can use. Totem barbarians are the most “utility” driven of the barbarian classes.

Totem barbarians can shapeshift as a bonus action, and as an animal, can perform their Totemic ability.

### Archtype Features

**Shape Shift:** The barbarian can shapeshift into an animal version of their spirit animal. At higher levels, they can shift into a dire animal version of their spirit animal.
**Bonus Action Utility:** Depending on spirit animal, the totem barbarian gains a bonus action ability (Movement, damage, damage resistance)


## Primal Barbarian 

Primal Barbarians are tied to the elements, and can harness them to do their will. They choose Fire, Earth, Frost, or Lightning, and deal additional damage of that element type in addition to gaining resistances to their chosen elements. They also get one utility ability tied to this element.

Primal barbarians can imbue their attacks with their element as a bonus action.

### Archtype Features

Imbue Element: The primal barbarian can imbue their weapon attacks with elemental damage.
Bonus Action Utility: Depending on elemental focus, the barbarian gains a bonus action ability.
