# Casting Disciplines

The planes interweaving throughout the world of Icara are teeming with magical energies. Raw magical power is embedded in the elements that make up the physical world, the primordial elemental and fae realms that they flow from, the metaphysical dream worlds powered by the dreams and emotions of the mortals, and the far removed eternal realms burning with alien magics. 

How the magic users of Icara tap into these powers depends on their Discipline. 

There are four major casting disciplines:

- **Arcane** - Spells that have been learned through study of the tenets of magic, experimentation, and a confluence of gestures, phrases, and material components used to focus the magic. The study of Arcana is highly personal, and the gestures, phrases, and components that work for one caster will not necessarily work for another - every caster must learn their own path to manipulate the weave. Also known as Metoc casting, from the kingdoms that created it under the guidance of elven sorcerers. 
    - Arcane casting is based on **Intelligence**.
    - Arcane casting is the discipline practiced by wizards, warlocks, arcane knights, and arcane tricksters.
- **Divine** - Spells that are granted to the caster from another being, such as a god or patron. Divine magic depends highly on faith and piety of the worshipper, and their personal connection to the source of power granting them power. 
    - Divine casting is based on **Wisdom**.
    - Divine casting is the discipline practiced by clerics and paladins.
- **Primal** - Spells that are cast by manipulating the natural forces around the caster, guiding the magical aspects of elements, spirits and essences that make up the natural world in a way that creates magic. These rituals are based on oral traditions and rituals resulting from observation and understanding of the world. These magic users cast spells by understanding and using the power that exists around them.
    - Primal casting is based on **Wisdom**.
    - Primal casting is the discipline practiced by druids and rangers.
- **Fae** - Spells that are cast using a magic users inborn power and raw ability to shape magical energies using sheer force of will. Many casters of fae have an innate connection to magic by their very nature, and it is through this connection that they shape and channel the magic. Most creatures that have innate spell abilities or inborn magical powers use fae magics, however, some create an artificial connection to magic by channeling magic through another connection to the magical world. Also called channel casting.
    - Fae casting is based on **Charisma**.
    - Fae casting is the discipline practiced by bards and sorcerers.



## Schools of Magic

Spells and magical effects are categorized by scholars and wizards into one of eight schools of magic. These schools include multiple subtypes, each of which covers specific types of magic. These subtypes are often described by non mages as domains, which determines many of the descriptions.
