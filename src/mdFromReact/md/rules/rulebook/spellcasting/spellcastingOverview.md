# Casting Disciplines

There are four major casting disciplines:

- **Arcane** - Spells that have been learned through study of the tenets of magic, experimentation, and a confluence of gestures, phrases, and material components used to focus the magic. The study of Arcana is highly personal, and the gestures, phrases, and components that work for one caster will not necessarily work for another - every caster must learn their own path to manipulate the weave. Also known as Metoc casting, from the kingdoms that created it under the guidance of elven sorcerers.
- **Divine** - Spells that are granted to the caster from another being, such as a god or patron.
