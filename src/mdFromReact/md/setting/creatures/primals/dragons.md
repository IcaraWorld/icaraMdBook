## DRAGONS - TRUE DRAGONS

The mightiest of the dragonkin, dragons are pure fae power. There
are 10 breeds of true dragons, the metallic dragons, and the
chromatic dragons. Each is tied to certain elemental powers, and all
are intelligent creatures capable of communicating with any creature
they have bothered to learn the language of. Since they are ageless,
and usually incredibly intelligent, that is often most of them.

Intelligence: High
Magic: High
Social Status: Solitary,
Threat Level: High

Dragons are ageless paragons of power and strength. Faeborn beasts with cunning and wisdom to match any mortal or eternal, immense
strength and power, these scaled behemoth's are descended directly from a being so powerful as to be worshiped as a living god across Icara.
Many of them are worshipped in their own right, the ancient forbears that have lived in Icara for generations untold.
There are many dragonkin, and most of them are simply beasts, contained of nothing but animal instinct and predator's cunning. However, the ten
true dragon lineages are deeply tied with the spiritual essences of Icara, and nothing like their degraded kin.
The metallic dragons resonate with purity of their divine flesh, armored by the divine metals; gold, silver, copper, iron, and bronze.
The chromatic dragons resonate with the chaos of elemental forces, and their scales are deeply imbued with them; red, blue, black, white and
green. These correspond with the elements of fire, air, earth, and water respectively, with the lesser green dragon representing an amalgamation
of these core elements. Some cultures do not consider the chromatic dragons as evil or separate from the metallic dragons, and equate their
scales with gemstones, and call them Ruby, Sapphire, Obsidian, Diamond and Emerald dragons respectively. These cultures tend to worship all
dragons.
Dragons themselves are their own entities. They do not form councils or civilizations...each exists as it's own kingdom unto itself. Dragons do not
feel the need to avenge each other out of some sort of communal species instinct, and generally are unconcerned with the "survival" of their
species. They consider themselves the dominant and undisputed rulers of Icara. Both collectively...and individually. It is the rule, not the
exception, that each dragon will act as if it is the most powerful being within Icara, and that all who meet it should act accordingly. A dragon who
feels wronged with visit its wrath on its enemies, typically without any assistance. That does not mean that dragons never have ties to other
things...however, they are not driven from anything but the dragons own preferences, and it may have more kinship with a mortal or the essence
of a place than with it's own progeny.

### Ecology of Dragons

Dragons are hatched from eggs, but are not reptiles or mammals, falling in their classification of creature. A dragon lays eggs not due to any
biological process, but an unknown magical one...each nesting, as far as scholar and rangers will tell you, is an immaculate conception. As such,
no one can define if a dragon is male or female, they just are.

**Wyrmling** - At the youngest age, freshly hatched, dragons are at their most bestial. They will typically be possessed of ravenous hunger, and
since even a hatchling is a 2 tons and around 12-15 feet long at birth, and they only get bigger from there. They will consume and devour what
they can, and wyrmlings are severe threat to a surrounding area. Since it can take a few hundred years to move beyond "wyrmlings" phase, many
tribes or civilizations will attempt to slay them in this stage, not only because of their indiscriminate feeding, but for fear of what may happen when
they become an adult. When someone has the title of "Dragonslayer"....they typically mean they have slayed a wyrmling...a difficult enough task
for any hunter, as larger wyrmlings can be up to 25-35' long.

**Adult** - As a dragon grows, they gain intelligence and understanding of the world around them. This is not necessarily through their own
experiences...even dragons that live within the depths of the Shadowdeep slowly gain knowledge of things they are completely separate from. It is
said that dragons absorb emotions and ideas from mortal creatures around them, as greater fae do, and are sustained by it. Others say that the
wisdom of the ancients is naturally passed down to dragons through their bloodline, and this knowledge is unlocked by a dragon as part of its
racial heritage. Under any circumstances, when a dragon has gained enough intelligence to surpass beasts and beastmen, they are considered
young adults. Sometime around this point, dragons realize they truly do not have to eat, and are sustained magically. Some dragons believe they
are sustained by their connection with magic, others by the natural world, and others by the worship of mortals. At any rate, a dragon will at this
point cease active hunting unless it is for sport or cruelty. Young adults grow more slowly than wyrmlings, but continue to grow.

**Mature** - As dragons get older and older, they become larger, stronger, and more powerful. A dragon will be considered fully matured if it has
survived more than a millennium. By this point, they've likely grown to a length of around 40-50' long. At this point, their growth will slow
drastically, but they will continue to grow throughout their life.

**Elder** - Any dragon that is has grown beyond 75' long is considered an elder dragon. These massive beasts are nigh indestructible, requiring
massive armies or tremendous power to bring down. Fortunately, most elder dragons have lost interest in petty squabbles of mortalkind long ago
by this point. If an elder dragon is angered, most kingdoms must accept their judgement as an act of the gods, and it is far more likely that an
elder dragon will be met by a delegation of pleading diplomats carrying tribute than an army.

Dragons are deeply infused with the magic of Icara, and all of them have many natural magical talents. The older they get, the more pronounced
these become. These generally fall under what is considered "fae" magics - controlling the elements, confusing or enchanting their enemies, and
various types of shapeshifting or polymorph magics. However, dragons are also perfectly capable of learning magical casting, as any intelligent
and willful creature of Icara is, and since they are immortal as well, there's no telling what tricks a dragon might get up to.

Each type of dragon has a specific type of breath weapon that it uses, which concentrates and releases its primordial essence in devastating
blasts. Over time, the use of this creates a build up of concentrated elemental "essence" within the dragons throat, which can be harvested in the
form of crystalline shards and lumps. There is generally a certain spot that has crystallized the most of this essence, which hunters call the "heart
crystal" or "breath gem." These are highly prized and quite valuable, as the older the beast, the more powerful the essence concentration is.

### Dragon Hoards

Treasure hunters speak of the hoards of dragons, as if they are greedy things that gather every coin they can. While this is true for some of them,
doubtless, for the most part, dragon hoards are usually sentimental in nature, or gathered as tribute/apology, and only hold as much significance
to them as the sentiment. It's actually not uncommon for dragons to abandon these so called hoards as they lose a reason to preserve them.
However, it's wise to consider whether the risk of finding an abandoned "hoard" outweighs the risk of stealing a dragon's favorite painting. 

### Primacy Amongst Dragons

Dragons have no natural predators from the worlds of beasts...they are big enough to seize and devour almost any beast on Icara. Their only true
dangers are armies of mortals, other primal forces, powerful demons, angels or fae, and of course, other dragons. Dragons rarely hunt each other
for no reason, and when they clash, it may be to the death or it may be to submission of one of them. Dragons that need it usually have an
established pecking order. All of this of course leads up to Bahaumut. Based on the legend of the dragon lead purge of the Second Age, all
scholars assume that dragons naturally follow the god of dragons.

### Ancient Dragons

Any dragon that existed prior to the Second Age, and still lives to this day. Most Icarians believe that there was only one ancient of each of the
metallic and chromatic dragons, and this dragon gave birth to all of the dragons of its bloodline. Most ancient dragons have been lost to the mists
of time, though dragon cultists believe that all of the ancient dragons live to this day.

#### Valumgrangr

The most accessible ancient is Valumgrangr, the ancient blue of the Dragonspine mountains. Valumgrangr is known because of its exceptional
greed, having made its home over the only direct natural pass between the rich coastal regions and Tarajah. For as long as anyone has known, it
has taxed the merchant wagons that have gone through, demanding a fee for anyone passing goods either way. Many say that it made the pass
for this express purpose. The creatures work fuels his small fiefdom of accountants, who typically worship him as a god, but whom are well
rewarded for their work. Some people whisper that he sits on a veritable mountain of gold and silver...in fact, tales say that in the Third Age, silver
and gold were traded in equal volume to copper, but Valumgrangr now owns most of it that exists.

Only a fool would risk stealing from the immense blue dragon by not paying taxes or, gods forbid, trying to steal from its hoard, and the
dragon does not hesitate to make an example of a fool. There have been armies that have sought to break the stranglehold it has upon the pass,
but Valumgrangr seems no less capable of punishing ten thousand fools than one fool, estimated at a terrifying 120 feet long and nearly 60 feet
tall, it resembles not so much a creature as a small moving city. When it flies overhead, the force of the wings beating are said to send anything
not secured crashing to the ground, including grown men.

#### 

The Black dragon of the south, who mastered necromancy and became a dracolich in the 4th Age in the hopes of becoming a god. He
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of coldbloods, malorians, orcs and sun elves, before the sun elves and dynastan killed him. Of
course, the north doesn't care about any of that, since it doesn't know about any of that.

#### Ancient Iron Dragon - Lost to the Abyss

The Iron dragon of the second age, who developed such a taste for killing demon kind that it followed them back into the Abyss. Legend says it hunts demons there to this day...though anyone with sense knows that it is certainly long dead.

## Dire Dragons

Dire dragons are more complicated. Examples of dire dragons include Storm Dragons, Sand Dragons, Fang Dragons, Mist Dragons,
Shadow Dragons, Magma Dragons, Vine Dragons, Lunar Dragons, Gemstone Dragons. Often resembling young dragons or wyrmlings in many
ways, these creatures may be intelligent, able to speak, shapeshift or use other magical abilities. They have lairs, may gather hoards, and may
even have cultists. However, Dire Dragons do not grow to the size of true dragons, require mates to lay eggs, and are not immortal. 

## Demonspawn Dragons

After their purge at the talons of dragonkind, the daemon lords of chaos within the Abyss worked their powers to create corrupt versions of the
monsters of Icara, in an attempt to subjugate them. This worked with varying success....demonic dragons can be intelligent, but like all demons,
they tend to be more forces of destruction than strategists. While these creatures mostly exist in the Abyss and the infernal realms connected to
them, a few have made lairs in Icara. 

## Fel Dragons

Like all life forms, Dragons can be corrupted by undeath. This happens either by choice or due to being killed and corrupted by Fel energy.

**Dracoliches** and **Blood Dragons** - While True Dragons should never require foul necromancy to gain eternal life, there are other benefits that a
dragon might seek in undeath. More often, though, it is Dire Dragons who seek to extend their life through magical means. Dracoliches function
as liches, storing their souls and life essence in phylacteries, letting their body fall to ruin. Blood Dragons use blood magic and constant sacrifices
to prolong their lives.

**Zombie**, **Skeletal** and **Ghost Dragons** - When a dragon has been killed, it is just as suspectible to having its corpse corrupted as any other
creature. While much more rare, a Dragon's soul can also be lost on the way back to the Weave.
