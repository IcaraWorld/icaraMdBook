## DRAGONS - DRAGONKIN

There are dozens of creatures with dragon-like appearance and features - behir, drakes, dragoths, faerie dragons, sea serpents, dragon turtles,
hydras, couatl, and landwyrms. There are multiple kinds of each of these dragonkin, and many have elemental traits as dragons do (such as frost
wyverns, or rock landwyrms.) Dragonkin can be distinguished from dragonkind because they have animal intelligence, nothing more. 

### Behir

Intelligence: Animal
Magic: Medium

### Drakes

### Dragoth

Description
The dragoth are the dumb brutes of the dragon-kin family. Immense,
wingless masses of muscle and dense scales, they roam the ground
of Icara on all fours as an alpha predator, devouring much of what
they run across. They tend to have short, muscled necks, powerful
running legs (they run on all fours) and strong tails they use for balance. They have thick, muscled jaws, and can have tusks, fangs,
or horns (or all three.) Dragoth often share traits, coloration, or
appearance vaguely with a true dragon type or another dragon-kin,
and are then referred to as whatever they appear to be (For example
- a blue dragoth or brass dragoth.) However, they can also be
completely unique, taking on traits to help them survive in whatever
pocket of Icara they live in.(In which case, they are just appended the
location name (Uruthian dragoth, coastal dragoth.)

Intelligence: Animal
Magic: Low
Social Status: Dangerous, Aggressive, Hungry
Threat Level: High

Combat
Dragoth tend to run down and overwhelm their prey, smashing or
trampling whatever obstacles are in there way. They often will ram
things aside with their head, or catch them in their mighty jaws and
crush them to death, shaking them to pieces or just allowing the
hazardous elements of their bite dissolve, burn, or otherwise kill their
prey. Dragoth may occasionally have a breath weapon, similar to a
dragon or drake, but often it is restricted to a flaming, electric, or
acidic bite, or just unchecked elemental energy bleeding from thier
claws, horns or tusks. They are easily distracted by the most
aggressive, mobile, or visible enemy, and a brave combatant can use
this to run them away from more vulnerable prey - however they are
fast, and tireless, and this is often a sacrificial tactic.
Ecology
After eating their fill in creatures, plants, or small structures (scholars
are frankly unsure that material eaten is even relevant or that they
have a natural ecology, diet or behavior, though they prefer meat), a
dragoth will typically find a lair and hunker down into it. However,
they are still incredibly destructive, often even more so that true
dragons, which have no need or inclination to rampage around
mindlessly. Dragoth are often hunted and killed if possible, which is
quite a feat - it's no wonder the man or woman who survives tangling
with these armored menaces often appends "Dragonslayer" to their
title, even though technically they are lesser dragonkin.
Dragoth are incredibly solitary creatures. They will find a mate if one
is available, sometimes roaming far afield to locate one, but with no
mate, they will simply live out their lives as a ill-tempered beast with a
small hunting ground. Most rangers and druids believe that dragoth
do not reproduce frequently enough to continue their species, and
suspect some form of elemental generation for the creatures.
