elemental dominions. However, many fae have become permanent
fixtures of Icara. Fae consider the all the different elemental planes a
single extended realm, despite the fact that few move through all the
realms easily. While all fae may seem similar, the difference between
a true fae (from the elemental or fae dominions) and an Icaran fae is
simple - true fae are born of the elements, and are immortal. The fae
of the world are mortal, born of other faekind.

## Faery Folk

### Fairies
Small, quick witted and quick winged, fairies are tiny lithe creatures
with elven features, and some form of wings. The wings of a fairy
vary, but typically reflect a winged creature within the area the fairy is
found. So a woodland fairy might have the wings of a bird or butterfly,
while a swampland fairy might have dragonfly wings. A subterranean
fairy might have beetle or bat wings. They have widely variant hair
and skin color.
Fairies frequently speak the languages of both the people and
animals in the area that they live. Like many fae, they tend to stay
where they were born. Fairies have innate magical powers, though
the nature and strength of these powers vary wildly.
