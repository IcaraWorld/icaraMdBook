# Rakasha

The rakasha people are a humanoid race that originated out of lands of the Dynastan Empire. Upon first glance, they might be mistaken for elves, for they share both the long pointed ears and the grace of the mystical people. This misperception is never kept up for long, for rakasha are more thickly built and move with the grace of an athlete or dancer, not the unnatural weightlessness of the fae. There are other subtle hints, such as the very sharp incisor teeth, the tendency to have thick, sharp nails on their hands and feet, the ability to grow facial hair, and yes....the distinctive catlike tail. 

There are several subraces of rakasha, corresponding to their hair color, skin color, and the type of tail that they have. These are the:

- **tiger** - Tiger rakasha have fair skin, with reddish or orange hair. Their eyes tend to be green or blue. 
- **lion** - Lion rakasha have lightly tanned to olive complexions, and their hair is varying shades of blond. They have dark yellow, green, or brown eyes.
- **panther** - Panther rakasha have light brown to dark brown skin, sometimes approaching pitch black. They have black hair, and brown or black eyes.
- **cougar** - Cougar rakasha tend to have very darkly tanned skin, often with a reddish hue. They have blond or brown hair, and brown or yellow eyes. 

Rakasha live about the same length of time as humans. They have developed a reputation as an inquisitive and perceptive people, very driven in a way traditionally associated with humans. While they tend to be both quick and athletic, the rakasha are no different from any other intelligent race in that they lean towards all manner of disciplines, be it physical, spiritual or arcane. Many are very competitive, and the rakasha stereotype is one that will do whatever is necessary to “win” at whatever they are competing for.

Like so many races of the south, the rakasha culture was long ago subsumed by the Dynastan culture. They have no real history separate from the Dynastan that is recorded or discovered, they simply live within the culture. They have, however, made a reputation for themselves despite that. The Dynastan discovered them to be excellent scouts and point men during their drive to conquer the world, and when that fell apart, they found them even more able ambassadors to that world. It was a rakasha diplomat that eventually brokered the treaty that ended the hostilities between the Dynastan Empire and the kingdoms of the north, and allowed trade to begin between them. In general, rakasha ambassadors negotiate so well that the rakasha has become synonymous with politics. Just as a king feels proud to include an elven minstrel or a dwarven armorer in his court, he would feel equal pride in including a rakasha diplomat or advisor.

Another trait commonly associated with this brash, adventurous people is trade. Rakasha are some of the most widely traveled merchants in the world, and there is no one they won’t trade with. Elves, orcs, dwarves, Dynastan, sauren, drow, or dragon, a rakasha has probably tried to market his wares and get gold or items in return. Many rakasha traders have zero moral compunction about selling or trading slaves with a vampire prince or a dark elf warlord, as long as they are compensated, and will often use their persuasive skills to deal with creatures and cultures that no one else would touch with a ten foot lance.

Though most historians agree that the rakasha race originated in the south, they have since spread across the known world. The rakasha drive to explore and expand is immense, and they have become common fixtures in almost every civilized kingdom. Rakasha don’t care about history, each living his life to accomplish his or her own goals. The greater good of the race never is a concern of theirs, and since they have no ancestral lands, they don’t feel tied to any culture or race. They go wherever they want whenever they want to do whatever they want however they want.

## Rakasha cities

Though rakasha rarely if ever are the majority population in a city, cities with large populations of these cat people tend to be merchant or trade cities. Rakasha usually like to show off their accomplishments, living in luxury and building magnificent buildings if they have the resources. While competent, they tend to have elvish or dwarven architects if at all possible, preferring status to actually building them themselves. While individual rakasha may stand out as artists, artisans, or craftsmen, as a race they aren’t known for anything specific.

## Rakasha Religion

Rakasha tend to be pragmatic about their religious beliefs, often worshipping the most accepted local pantheon. Rakasha traditionally worshipped Kronos, Malor, Ra and Isis, but since being introduced to the northern gods Loki has become prevalent amongst the rakasha as well.
