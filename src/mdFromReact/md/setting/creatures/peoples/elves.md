# Elves

Elves are a magical race of humanoids descended directly from the fae creatures of the Fae wild. While they are not immortal, elves never die of old age, in fact, they never seem to age past adult. Even an elf centuries old looks just as young and fresh as the day he stopped growing, and unless misfortune, disease, or war robs him of function, just as able as a young elf. A full blooded elf has never died of old age in all of recorded history, though they are just as susceptible to sickness, weather, or violence as any other creature. However, elves that are approaching the millennial mark often disappear one day with their most valued possessions, never to return. Elves themselves believe their missing brethren have chosen to live within the immortal fae in some secret, pristine, primal land, or have ascended to be immortal watchers over the realm of Icara. The oldest elf still present in Icara (that is known) is close to three millennium old, a high elven priest of Jarallan named Mezias. It is fortunate they are so long lived, because have a very low natural birthrate, rarely having more than two children within a century. 

The elven race is composed of five major subraces, High Elves, Shadow Elves, Wood Elves, Sun Elves, and the Gray Elves, which stemmed from two major branches of elves - the Sun Elves, and the Moon Elves. The Sun Elves have largely kept their racial identity intact, however, the Moon
Elves fractured into three major subsets - the High Elves, the Shadow Elves, and the Wood Elves. The Gray Elves are of thought to be the result of repeated minglings of elves.

## High Elves

High elves are alternately called Moon Elves, especially in ancient writings. The high elves themselves prefer the term high elves, to demonstrate the belief that they are the last protectors of elven culture and true elven heritage. The high elven people are fair-skinned, with hair colors ranging from blond to black. Like all of the elves, they have a lithe form, with angular features and pointed ears, and grow no facial or body hair. The elves favor beautiful jewelry, clothing, music, and art, but are culturally less materialistic than other races, because they have a collective sense of accomplishment and ownership. The philosophy is that everything created is for the good of the race and the world. They freely share possessions and information between themselves, with no reservations.

They don’t share the same consideration with other races, such as humans or dwarves, or even the other sub-races. High elves consider themselves more  cultured than their elven brethren and wiser than the other races in almost every way. After all, an elf is considered young for three to four decades, and while they physically mature at about half the rate of humans, they aren’t typically considered mature by other elves until they are almost a century old. For this reason, even a venerable human man of 90 is still a child to them. They tend to treat other short lived races accordingly. As for  dwarves and other elvish subraces, they treat them as one would treat an ignorant or uneducated man, polite, but distant, amused by their antics at  best, annoyed by their lack of decorum at worst.

Elves value education. Learning the ways of war, magic, and hunting are high priority, and almost all elves are expected to have some form of martial skill, whether it is healing magic or swordsmanship. Elves spend huge portions of their young lives reading, researching and practicing a variety of skills. Individual history, family lineage and similar considerations often very prevalent in human nobility are considered less relevant for high elves than the knowledge and wisdom one has gained. Periodically, most elves will travel to the great elven city Elphyius to have their own thoughts, teachings and works recorded by the scribes there, to make sure that knowledge is able to be passed down to other elves. Almost all elves have a working knowledge of a wide variety of subjects as a result. 

Because elves don’t settle in the same way that humans do, elven society can seem chaotic and random to an observer. Elves rarely marry, rarely commit to an occupation, and very rarely settle in a single area. A traveler could pass through an elven kingdom, and buy goods from a baker, only to pass through a distant elvish town years later to find the same elf working as a blacksmith. The high elf often lets whimsy determine his career choices, as they have untold decades to discover what best suits them.

This of course creates some confusion in their society. Elves don’t believe in setting laws for each other, believing that all laws worth having are common sense anyway, so there is no point trying to explain common sense. If you don’t have it, you aren’t going to learn it. They also are disgusted by
the thought of directing to others how an elf should act. (Keep in mind, however, that they are more than happy to direct the “children” of the world in proper behavior, and set both laws and rules for them at will.)

However, occasionally the need arises for the elves to make decisions for their entire people. To accomplish this, each group of high elves select a council of prominent elves, the Synedra, to make laws, judge crimes, and determine whether or not the elves need to go to war. New members are selected by the current Synedra, usually based on the knowledge or experience that they have demonstrated. For example, a noted philosopher or wizard would probably be voted in, or a prestigious doctor or priest. Non elves may never be part of this council. When a matter of importance is brought up, all members of the community’s Synedra are summoned, whichever ones bother to show up determine the matter with discussion and vote. To determine the matters of the elvish race as a whole, the Aeiris Synedra, or High Senate, exists in the heart of the elvish kingdom, Elphyius. Only the wisest and most powerful of the elves are invited to join this prestigious company.

### High Elf Cities

Elven architects build around natural scenery whenever possible, and do the best they can to avoid destroying or disrupting the land on which they build. That said, high elves favor permanent structures built of beautiful rocks such as marble whenever possible, and love to assist in the building of grand temples or castles. However, since elves are never satisfied to be tied down, finishing a project that is started can take centuries, as an elf may leave mid-construction to pursue another interest, or even pass along the work to another elf. A building with multiple architect styles throughout is a common sight in an elven city, as is an empty building. An elf does not necessarily build a house so he can settle in it, he builds it to create something of beauty and function. He knows that some elf will live in it eventually.

While the ideals of elves may make one think that they’ve done away with monetary concepts all together, it isn’t true. The elves recognize the basic importance of placing a value on their work, and usually follow the basic pricing concepts of whatever races are around them, tacking on a little extra
because elvish goods are bound to be better than those of other races. They are quick to freely give things that cost them nothing to another elf in their community, even one newly joined. Travelers must pay them, because otherwise they are doing nothing to further the kingdom of elves. That said, elves try to treat the other races well and be proper hosts whenever possible.

### High Elven Religion

High elves tend to worship Jarallan, Tyra or Ale’vandra predominantly, with sporadic worship of either Illyriel or elemental gods. Worship of Lilith is also not unheard of, but tends to be done in secret, as the religion is considered taboo. It is almost unheard of for a high elf to worship outside of the elvish Pantheon, nor is it uncommon to worship all of them (excepting Lilith) at once.

## Wood Elves

The wood elves look very similar to high elves, except their skin tends to be a darker color, more deeply tanned. Wood elves favor simple clothing and simple hairstyles. They rarely wear any jewelry, choosing their garments for function over appearance. They often dress in finely made leathers and
cloths. They tend to travel in relatively small and tight knit tribes or groups, living primarily in forested areas. Wood elves are usually deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially if they aren’t elves.

Destructive humanoids like humans, dwarves, dynastan and orcs that clear land or destroy natural environments for farming or other endeavors are especially despised. Perhaps more than any other creature, wood elves attempt to live within the context of nature without harming it. They identify deeply with Tyra the elven goddess of nature, and do their best to protect her creatures and animals. They are nomadic hunter/gatherers, though a single tribe will occasionally settle the same area for a long period of time. They tend to live in tents and other mobile structures, and unlike high elves, marry and form families. They are overprotective of each other, and quick to band together against an interloper.

A wood elven tribe elects a leader, or one naturally arises though battle, hunting, or wise council. The leader decides the fate of criminals, disputes, and all other matters. Leaders in wood elven society are often druidic priests, picked for their closeness with nature. Even though wood elves do not
associate with many of the other elves or civilized races, they are often on excellent terms with all other creatures of the forest. A wood elf does not hesitate to side with a dryad or treant over a human or high elf, believing as they do that Nature’s wisdom is perfect wisdom.

### Wood Elf Cities

These are usually nothing more than tent cities, and wood elves do not engage in much commerce. When they are open to trade, it is simply barter. Wood elves do not honor the borders or treaties that are agreed on by the rest of the world as a general rule. They simply go where they will. If they
determine that a person or society is a threat to the natural world, they will destroy that which threatens their beloved habitat. If their actions lead to war, they will fight or flee.

### Wood Elf Religion

Wood elves almost exclusively worship Tyra. No other creed is recognized within traditional wood elf society as appropriate.

## Shadow Elves

Shadow elves are similar to high elves in build, but their skin is a dark gray to a deep black. The eyes of a dark elf range from red, black and purple to a solid white. Their hair color is white, gray, or black, though many dark elves dye it in purples, blues, and reds. Shadow elves delight in jewelry and accessories, and tend to dress in silks. Shadow elves prefer dark colored armors and weaponry, creating steel and mithral alloys of tinted black and blue. Shadow elves consider armor and weaponry a fine accessory, and wear them as part of their everyday wardrobes. Shadow elves determined long ago in their history that the other races would do nothing but harm them and the world. They also determined that these races and societies should be destroyed.

Unfortunately, there was enough unified resistance to that plan that overt war failed. In the centuries that followed, dark elves became more and more competitive with each other, making it impossible for them to wage a unified war anywhere. Regardless, dark elves lives are still skewed to warfare,
whether with each other or with whoever is unfortunate enough to fall in their path, since even a single dark elven house of a hundred warriors can lay waste to a city with enough planning and the element of surprise.

Shadow elves sense of family lineage is much more pronounced than even high elves. Family history and tradition are very important to them. As a rule, dark elves do not leave the family when they mature, staying inside the same house or complex as their ancestors and children. The eldest matriarch of the dark elven home acts as the leader of the dark elven family. The family, in addition to mercenaries and slaves, make up a self sufficient merchant and military unit. Shadow elves compete with each other and other races for everything, from weaponry to magical knowledge. These different houses make up the dark elven society. The heads of all the houses in a city meet to determine the course of action for the city, and to judge houses that have crossed the lines of conduct. Shadow elves are supposed to dispense justice in their own house. If the city has to step in, the penalty is always
much harsher.

Shadow elven society is matriarchal. Since dark elves do not marry, the mother of a child is considered its guardian, and the child joins her house. Since most of the important figures in dark elven history are female, starting with the ascent of their original leader to godhood, dark elven women are
considered more important than men. And the society reflects it, with many elven women treating their male counterparts as possessions or lackeys.

Shadow elves are obsessed with breeding the more terrifying fae creatures, attempting to improve them with magic, either as tools of war, dark elf mounts as well as pets, and many wandering explorers have become meals for the twisted cast offs that are deemed failures and thrown out to wander the tunnels. Shadow elves love magic as much as they love weaponry, and a dark elf wizard may have a hundred ways to take the flesh from his enemies’ bones, and ties to dozens of fae, and binding power of dozens of additional demonic creatures. Another dark elf love is alchemy. Shadow elves love to employ venom and synthetic poisons, whether it is a fast acting agent that drops a foe in his tracks or a creeping death to cause untold agony in victims.

Slavery is a point of contention for the dark elves, with some considering the reliance on non-elves an unforgivable weakness, while others consider it a practical way to preserve elven lives while still maintaining large standing armies or work forces. The second line of reasoning assures it is a booming business for the dark elves that partake, and it is one of the few mercantile agreements that they have with the outside world. It is rumored that if it breathes and moves, a dark elf will attempt to enslave, use, sell, or kill it. Since all non-elven races are beneath them, they think nothing of buying and selling other intelligent creatures as they would a pack mule.

### Shadow Elven Cities

While the dark elf people originally took to the caves and tunnels of the world because they were driven away from their beloved homeland forests, they have grown fond of their homes tucked away in the shadows of the world. The dark elves build hidden fortresses of stone and steel, secreted behind hidden doors and illusionary walls. Shadow elves love beauty as much as any elf, they find cruel and deadly things beautiful. Traps and spell runes are common fixtures, as are deadly dark elven pets. While most dark elven cities are hidden, a few grand ones exist openly in the massive caverns of the Shadowdeep. Here, the Shadow elves have built massive structures from floor to ceiling, in addition to building giant structures hanging like stalactites above. Visiting a dark elven city is bound to be deadly for an outsider, since most interlopers are executed or enslaved on sight.

### Shadow Elven Religion

Shadow elves traditionally worship Lilith, though occasional or minor worship of another elvish god such as Jarallan, Tyra, or an elemental god is not rare. Shadow elves will also occasionally worship Magus, taking great glee in both his actions against the enemy of their goddess and the freedom the God of Dark Magic provides. Shadow elven worshippers of Magus tend to claim Magus is a shadow elf himself.

## Sun Elves

Sun elves primarily live deep to the south within the realms of the Dynastan Empire. They are slightly taller than their brethren, with light brown to dark brown skin. Their hair is almost always black, though sometimes it is a brown or gray color instead. Their eye color is usually a brown or a black,
though greens and grays can occasionally be found. Sun elf kingdoms once stood throughout the lands, and they were chief engineers of the Metoc kingdoms, which civilized the human people. 

Unfortunately, they were steadily driven south, as whenever attempts to negotiate and bargain for peace failed for various reasons, they would cede ground rather than engage in what they considered pointless and immoral wars. In addition, this race of elves is deeply embedded in the natural flow of 
arcane magic, and more than any other race suffered from the disruption of magic that took place at the apex of the Fourth Age. For all of these reasons, these magic loving and erudite pacifists was almost eradicated in the northern lands.

Finally, driven to the south, the Sun elves ran out of room to migrate, and shed their desire to compromise with their surroundings further. Since then, they have made a resurgence. However, there has been little desire by the Sun elves to reclaim their ancient homelands, and they still would prefer to remain outside conflicts if they can. Centuries of good intentions causing tragic results have take a toll on the Sun elf outlook. Where once the Sun Elves attempted to interject themselves into conflict to calm and resolve situations, they are now content to let the world find its own path, and live 
within themselves as a race. They tend to develop hidden cities, camouflaging them with geography or magic. These cities are rarely if ever appear on any common maps, and though sun elves will allow visitors and travelers into their cities, any city that becomes popular with outsiders is gradually
abandoned. Suns elves are lead by a single leader, always one who could lead them decisively in a war. Sun elves delight in physical prowess, with even magic users routinely exercising and keeping in shape. Foot races and swimming contests are common, as well as hunting for sport.

The elves also have maintained their love of magic, particularly magics of heat and flame, which has ties to their religious and philosophical history. They enjoy enchanting items, and Sun elven creations can fetch a high price due to their quality and the reclusive nature of their makers. Unlike many other Southern races, the Sun elves have never been subject to systemic slavery from the Dynastan people (although slave traders will always make exceptions.) The Dynastan religion forbids it, as the Sun Elves befriended the Dynastan ancestors, making the Empire possible. 

A very proud people, sun elves do everything they can to maintain independence from the Dynastan empire, despite the long standing alliance between them. They live far from the empire’s cities, and don’t interact with other races much, preferring to live away from their demands and influences. Sun
elves are often mistakenly compared to wood elves because of this, but the Sun elves are very different. They do not feel the same need to steward and protect the land. They are much more likely to look with forgiving eyes on the other races, and are charitable to those races in need. When they
engage in war, it is strictly to defend themselves. 

### Sun Elf Cities

Sun elves live in cities woven into the treetops. These cities are built primarily of wood, but may have stone structures crafted within them for enhanced for strength and durability. The cities can be quite large, and have many of the normal sights and sounds of a normal city, from a market place to bakeries, smithies and family dwellings. The normalcy obscures the fact that the cities can be over a hundred feet above the ground. These cities are commonly the ones seen by travelers, if any make contact with the Sun elves. The lost and ruined cities of the Sun Elves are similar in nature to the
cities of the High elves. Some whispers speak of even greater ruins to be found, and many treasure hunter have sought an undiscovered lost city of the Sun Elves, to claim the treasures inside.

### Sun Elf Festivities

Sun elves tend to celebrate holidays based on cosmic events based on solar calendars. However, they are so long lived, they tend to mark things not annually but at decade or century marks. This also means that when they have a festival, they do it properly, and it is not uncommon for a sun elf festival to last for weeks or even months.

### Sun Elven Religious and Philosophy

Sun elves worship Ra, either alone in conjunction with Isis, in traditional Sun elf society. The Sun elves consider Ra their creator, and believe that the Moon elves simply refer to Ra as Jarallan and do not truly consider it a conflict of beliefs, despite a very different religious perspective.
Sun elves have a very conflicted view of their place in Icara.

### Secrets of the Sun Elves

The Sun Elves maintain an external fiction, that they are a depleted and dying race. They do this so that people will not seek their magics, their wisdom, their help. And so they hide their small towns in jungle tree tops, and when visitors come, they see a simple people living a simple
lifestyle, much like their wood elf brethren.

However, this is not the true society of these ancient fae-kin. Sun elves true societies, and the majority of the people, live hidden away in great cities, disguised by magic and stone. These great cities are hidden within the natural world, beautiful stone architecture sculpted lovingly by magic or by hand. Perfectly smooth walkways spiral between these great buildings, and gemstones stretched to parchment thickness and reinforced by enchantment cast beautiful light into massive chambers In these places the history of the Sun elf race is stored in expansive libraries and great museums. Craftsmen
who have lived a hundred lifetimes craft exquisite items of all types, and peaceful people who have never known bloodshed or death in their long lives
hide behind the protective magics master enchanters weave. It is not uncommon for these elves live fully on the fruits of immaculately maintained gardens, which are more than sufficient to feed them and prevent them from having to leave the city at all, should they consider it risky These cities are often hidden behind natural barriers that are rarely open, such as through tunnels in riverbeds that are only dry every hundred years, or behind active volcano ranges that are so prevalent on the southern peaks of the sir mountain range. In addition, sun elf enchantments along the way can confuse and turn around travelers, or simply block the path with great boulders or dense jungle that only opens to those who know the path or the time when it is open.

Finally, the sun elf sorcerers and warriors are always wary of interlopers, and seek to draw them away to protect the secrets of the cities. As a result, few outsiders ever find a sun elf great city, and of those that find it, the sun elves will usually give the lucky explorer the choice of living in the city for the rest of their days, or be free to leave with their minds wiped away with powerful enchantments and geas spells, to prevent the outsider from revealing what they've found.

## Gray Elves

Gray elves are of questionable heritage. Some say that gray elves are disaffected elven peoples that have been cast out of the larger elf societies, others say that gray elves are the result of other elven sub-races intermingling. Gray elves themselves tend to agree that they share an ancestry with all elves, but state that the grey elf is what comes of elves who stop focusing outward to achieve perfection and start focusing inward. Gray elves have many great talkers, that enjoy whiling away an evening with philosophy or riddles. Gray elves have skin tone of light blue to light gray. Their eyes can be blue, purple, or green. Gray elf hair tends to match eye color, if it doesn't, the hair is either white or black. The gray elven people tend to dress as the cultures around them, if there are no dominant cultures around them, they prefer silks and light jewelry. 

Gray elves generally live around the coasts and waterways, making homes on islands and around river deltas. They have much less regard for elven history and elvish civilization than the other elves, usually living like the predominant culture around them. They will often gather great amounts of knowledge within these cultures. If they are not part of the surrounding culture, they tend to gather in clans or tribes. Gray elves normally make contact with cultures that live near them, for both trade and interaction. They are less pretentious as a whole than most elves, making them slightly easier to
live around then a high elf or sun elf and safer to live around than a wood elf or dark elf.

### Gray Elf Cities

Their city type is generally that of those around them. They build ports along coasts and castles if they are in a feudal land. The few famous cities that gray elves have are sea bound castles that float along the waves, and even these are tinged with the cultures of other creatures, often housing human or rakasha populations.

### Gray Elf Religion

Gray elves do not follow traditional elvish worship, often worshipping outside of the Elvish Pantheon as well as within it. Favored gods of the Gray elves include Ale’vandra, Ra, Isis, Illyriel, Venus, Magus, and Loki.

## Half-elves

Half Elves are the children of elves and humans. Their facial features often mimic that of elves, with high cheekbones, sharp, angular ears, and almond shaped eyes. They do, however, have facial and body hair as a human would. They are usually taller and more thickly built than elves. Half elves tend
toward human cultures, as they are usually considered exotic and looked highly upon in those cultures, while in elvish cultures they tend to be treated no differently than a human.
