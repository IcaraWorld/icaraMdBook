# Orcs

Orcs are a large humanoid race, usually standing between 6 to 7 feet tall. They have rough skin in colors ranging from dark to light brown and dark to light green depending on subrace. They are usually muscular, and have flat, snout like noses and thick, prominent jaws with protruding tusks. Their hair color ranges from reds and browns to grays and blacks. It is not uncommon for an orc to be born hairless, or shave his head as a mark of his clan or of personal prestige. Orcs are one of the most prevalent races on all of Icara, due to their extensive procreation and adaptability. The two main subsets of this race are the cave orcs and the black orcs. Additionally considered orcish is the ogrillion, a powerfully built subset possibly interbred with other races that claims orcish blood and ancestry that exists in much smaller numbers. 

Orcs have a well deserved reputation as a brutal and bloodthirsty people. They live in tribes, either small ones, or large ones where multiple family clans of orcs form a gigantic tribe of thousands. Orc clans tend to be nomadic, roaming frequently throughout Icara. They tend to be territorial regarding travel routes, or specific tracts of land they come to rest at, trying to drive off or subjugate existing owners, or at least cow them into compliance. Orcs rarely tolerate the other intelligent races within their community as equals or peers, but often integrate other creatures into their societies. Large orc clans take slaves to serve them until they are inconvenient or subservient allies of smaller or weaker monsters. Smaller orc clans form alliances with powerful monstrous races or strong kingdoms if necessary to help protect the clan.

Orcs are typically lead by a powerful leader who is the chief, clan head, or religious leader. A weak leader is not tolerated, and killed by one seeking to be lead. Strength, ferocity, capability, and usefulness are the merits upon which an orc is judged. Orcs raise their children similarly, preferring to
kill weak or cowardly ones young before they can waste too much food, space, or time for the clan. 

Orcs breed incredibly quickly, with females carrying young for only a few months, and often birthing more than one at a time. They could care less about a death or two, and while orcs have family ties, they quickly become disgusted with family members that can't carry their own weight. This applies both ways, as the young are usually the ones to put down their elders, when they determine they are no longer useful to the clan. It is for this reason that an infirm or crippled orc is a rarity. The clan simply replaces them.

Orcs are voracious eaters. It takes a tremendous amount of food to keep them satiated, as such, food is almost always a large issue for a clan. Large orc clans tend to be incredibly hard on their environment, often depopulating an area of both animals and plants before moving on, or just by passing through. Nomadic tribes are often comparable to a swarm of locusts for all practical purposes, and it is this all consuming need for food that most often drives them into direct conflict with other races. 

## Grul Orcs

Grul orcs are the most widely seen of the orcish races. So much so, that they often just are known as orcs. Their name is a slight misnomer, as they are usually a dark green color, although light greens and grays are not uncommon either. There are occasionally black orcs born, these orcs are usually seen as a portent of coming power in traditional orcish societies, and are considered to be destined for great things. Orcs usually live above ground, and are typically a nomadic and tribal people. Grul orcs tend to be nomadic, and depending on the size of the tribe, either act as hunter/gatherers or herdsman, driving great packs of beasts along migratory routes. These beasts are typically wild, with a number of tamed creatures within the herd or pack that allow the orcs greater control over the heard. 

### Grul Orc Cities

As previously suggested, most orc settlements are temporary for black orcs. In cases where they find and establish permanent homes, they typically set up homes in caves, mountain passes, and other defensible locations. The majority of the tribe will still roam in nomadic fashion, only returning to set stores of food, trade, or gather for religious or political purposes.

### Grul Orc Religion

Grul Orcs have varied gods depending on location and culture. When they have chosen a god, it is usually only a single god, as warring religious
factors will thin a tribe very quickly. Grul Orcs worship Grkazr or Skarik most commonly, with worship of Pyrus or Malor the next most common, and they may also worship Magus or Ashtar as well. 

Many orcish religions, in addition to the tenants of the host religion, tend to be supplemented by orcish legend and superstition as well. Many orcs believe that as they die and move to the next life, they will be in a similar existence of hunting, gathering, war and battle, especially if they prove
themselves strong and cunning enough. In addition, orcs strongly believe they may meet their enemies in this next life - and they take extreme precautions to ensure they do not meet on even footing. Orcs will often maim and torture those they capture before killing them, chopping off hands or feet, burning them to death, cutting off their faces so the victims gods cannot recognize them and let them into the next life, Other orcs will torture a victim just to determine its strength, to determine if it is worth taking a trophy from. These beliefs vary depending on religion and area, but are typically considered remnants superstitions from the worship of Grkazr the Bonesnapper, for whom ritualistic torture is a tenant of the religion and the suffering of the victim is paramount. However, even orcs worshiping other gods consider it a common sense - there's no reason risking letting a vengeful ghost enter the afterlife whole. As a result, most sentient creatures fear being taken alive by orcs.

## Drekk Orcs

The Drekk orcs are subterranean dwelling orcs. They tend to be a yellowish, light brown, or dark brown color, and tend to be completely hairless. They tend to have solid eye color of red, yellow, or black, and they can see in the dark. They are shorter than most orcs, but heavily muscled. Cave orcs are just as antisocial as their overland dwelling brethren. They will kill or subjugate anything that comes into their caves. They are more feared by the people that live near them, for cave orcs are famous for eating almost anything - including the bodies of their enemies and captives, and even their own dead.

### Drekk Orc Cities

Drekk orcs tend to be territorial, and they gather in warrens, which they often protect with primitive but brutal traps. They hunt and return to the 
same warrens, often never moving from the warrens they were born into. It is easy for these warrens to become overpopulated, as orcs breed very quickly, when this happens the orcs range out farther and farther to hunt - some groups never returning, others forming new warrens elsewhere. These population cycles can also lead to upheaval within the warren, leading to bloody civil wars or purges.

### Drekk Orc Religion

Drekk orcs are most likely to simply worship Grkazr. Cave orcs that do not worship Grkazr usually worship Skarik or Pyrus. Cave orc religion is
much more simplistic, and often offers sacrifices to their gods as part of their religion. They often are also engaged in constant warfare, driven by
their leaders, for if their numbers are too numerous, they simply have to purge themselves - so the risk of conquering another subterranean city is
often worth the reward. 

## Tkul Orcs

The Tkul Orc people live within the southern jungles, usually following the religions of the creatures around them.

## Ogrillion

Ogrillion are giant orcish creatures that tower over most orcs. They are thickly built, usually with prominent tusks and bony protrusions that grow from a variety of locations on their body, especially their shoulders, elbows, arms and fists. These bones regrow rapidly if torn, ripped out or otherwise destroyed, and it is not uncommon for the boney growths to snap off in the flesh of an enemy during combat, festering into disease in the untreated wounds quickly. If the process causes an ogrillion pain, it would be hard to tell with the glee with which they choose to rip their foes asunder.

Ogrillions are well known for their brutality and vicious nature. Ogrillions do not gather in tribes of ogrillions, and are generally abandoned by their parents at a fairly young age, or kill their parent in a domination clash. Because of their large size and physical advantages, they usually lead or hold a place of honor in whatever tribe they gravitate toward. For this reason, they will usually join an orcish tribe or live as the head of subjugated monster tribes of creatures such as ogres, goblins, hobgoblins or similar creatures. Other ogrillions live alone, deciding upon a territory and then
holding it themselves. Ogrillions are truly feared on the battlefield, and often fight with no greater weapons than their own bone covered hands. Their great strength, cunning and viciousness often makes them whirlwinds of destruction, even without additional weapons.

Scholars surmise that ogrillions are the racial legacy of a titan spawned race, such as ogres or giants, breeding with orcs. The result was a creature that truly captured the best (or worst, depending on your perspective) traits of each race. The shrewd intelligence of the orc, the great strength and size of an ogre, blended with the unusual makeup of their bone spur covered body. They are truly fearsome creatures, and it is fortunate that they are rare and territorial, for an army of ogrillions would be terrifying indeed.

## Half Orcs

Half orcs typically are outcasts, as they are typically considered weak by their orcish brethren and monsters by humans. Often, a half-orc will end 
up having to prove themselves to be much more savage then the tribe they live in to survive in orcish society, or thrive in a lawless human settlement. Alternately, they drift south to Dynastan lands, where they are treated the same as most other humanoids by the draconic people.

## Orc Biology

Orcs are bipedal humanoids, with leatherlike skin, considerably more muscular than humans. They are generally heavier, with thick limb bones with large joints. Their head is longer and lower than a human, with neck connecting with the skull at an angle rather than the aligned with the spine as is typical to other intelligent humanoids, supported by thick corded neck and back muscles. Orcs have large jaws and teeth, with pronounced canines on top and tusklike canines on bottom that often protrude from thier mouths.They have naturally high muscle hypertrophy (prominent development of skeletal muscle).

Both male and female orcs have rapid and frequent production of a hormone similar to testosterone, around 3 times that of the human equivalent. This directly impacts muscle growth, recovery time and regrowth of bone and hair, as well as increasing the pain threshold. It also drives a rapid metabolism that sheds fat quickly, but requires great deals of calories to feed. Behaviors impacted include increased aggressiveness, competitiveness, sex drive, and need to dominate for both sexes. 

Orcs reproduce rapidly. Orcish women experience a rapid pregnancy cycle, with around 3 months on average to carry a child to term. Once birthed, children grow to adolescence at around the rate of humans, typically begin entering into relationships by 13 or 14 years old. Orcs are perceptive, solution oriented and quick thinking, in the way that hunter gatherers tend to be. 

### Historical Racial Impact on Culture

Orcish social interactions tend to be terrifying to non-orcs. Because they are instinctively aggressive, brutishly strong, have high pain tolerance
and frequently seek alpha status in whatever social group they are in, they often become violent with themselves and other races during both casual interaction as well as more intense social exchanges. They are also ravenous, frequently exhausting food resources. It is nearly impossible to support an orcish society through farming, as the land does not produce food quickly enough to satisfy their feeding habits. They also rapidly swell in numbers during periods of abundance, only to fall into civil unrest and violence when food supplies run low and starvation begins. 

Orcish priorities tend to fall toward maintaining food supplies, and strong inner circle of competent orcs that they can trust when starving times
come. This leads to social hierarchies formed through constant confrontation and testing for dominance, as well as either a nomadic lifestyle where new food sources are constantly located, or jealously hoarding and protecting resource heavy areas from other interlopers, be they orc or otherwise.

This has led to orcs being consistent outsiders. Orcs are open to peace during times of abundance, but typically then overbreed and overtax the land, leading to famine, which then leads to conflict. While within non-orcish society, they act in a way that is typical to them but unacceptable for the host society, because they are so much more aggressive. Because orcs are so numerous and hard to feed, they place little value on the lives of others, including in many cases their own kin. Traditional orcish culture exposes newborns who appear to be crippled or retarded, and often kill those who aren't quick to develop. As orcs age past their prime, they are typically either killed by other orcs seeking their position or turned out to wander and die.

They are considered a blight by most other cultures, for it takes little for orcs to reduce an entire area to famine and violence. While some orcish leaders have tried to mitigate the natural lifestyle of the orcs to varying degrees of success, nature typically wins out over a long enough time frame.
