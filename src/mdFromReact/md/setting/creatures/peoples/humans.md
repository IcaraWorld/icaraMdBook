# Humans

Humans, the salt of Icara. Though they stepped onto histories stage as insignificant, terrified tribes of creatures worshiping the god-elves of the
Faewoods, the short-lived and ever ambitious peoples spread across the face of Icara. Unlike so many of the other tribes, the humans built upon every war, tragedy and gift of both immortal and mortal, using it to forge their manifest destiny. Having carved out kingdoms in the north, south, east, and west, humans now expand ever further into the unexplored lands of Icara, seeming untroubled by the dangers they uncover.

The humans of Icara live in a world where they are never the strongest, quickest, or wisest. The odds seem ever stacked against them, as they compete against elves or dwarves centuries their elder for respect, and wage war against massive monsters for territory and resources. However, humans are dauntless, with a strong will to overcome adversity and triumph over incredible odds. While many humans live their lives without making waves, there are so many that strive to be kings, heroes, villians...many humans make their mark in history. This spirit has lead to them forging into the wilderness in all directions, leaving little unexplored. Human settlements can be found almost everywhere on Icara, even into hostile lands they have no business treading in.

Human's are favored consorts of all manner of otherworldly creatures. The ageless fae have reveled in the joy and sorrow of the emotional humans for centuries untold, delighting in the Machiavellian twists and turns of human interactions. When the humans breached the dimensional walls of Icara and discovered the celestial and infernal realms, the inhabitants and rulers of those realms quickly sought to find dominion over these .
