# Malorians

The beastmen of Icara are intelligent, mammalian humanoids creatures. They are native to the Icara, living their lives on the outskirts of the great empires forged by the dominant races.

## Kobolds

### Description

Kobolds are small, quick creatures with long features and thin, spindly arms and legs. They have oversized hands and feet, perfect for gripping all manner of things, and hairless tails. They usually have a small set of horns, are relatively hairless save for sparse scruffs of hair, and are a brown or reddish color.

### Combat 
Kobolds are clever, and make up for their lack of size with deadly traps, twisting escape paths and secret passageways. They also enjoy creating volatile alchemic concoctions, which they consume, explode, or coat traps or weapons with. (Sometimes all three.) 

### Culture/Community

Kobolds tend to gather near other intelligent population groups (whether human, orc, Dynastan, etc.) Kobolds often live off of their neighbors through scavenging, trade, or outright theft. They are notorious tricksters. Ridiculous hoarders, kobolds store all manner of things in secret caches and  warrens. They're only natural nemesis are goblins, which will fit in similar size warrens and caves - the two will often fight over tunnel systems too cramped to be of use to larger creatures. Kobolds love pets, captives, and other things to amuse themselves with, and will often create elaborate toys or games to do so. 

Kobolds will often act as go betweens for different races - the need to stir drama and trouble almost overrides their survival instinct.

### Religon/Beliefs
Kobolds are rumored to worship Loki, Bhaal, or Hob. For the most part however, they seem a secular society bent on their own ends. Kobolds very rarely seem to have religious fervor - they are practical creatures, if mischievous or malevolent on occasion. 

**Intelligence:** High
**Magic:** None
**Social Status:** Social and open to trade
**Threat Level:** Moderate

"What's a kobold? Shite, ain't you ever been out the house?. Kobolds what ya get if a shaved rat screwed a mean monkey. If ya need to see the thing, go poke the nearest trash pile. One'll be about. Likelier than not, last five things you lost, shifty kobold got three of em." - Geren Silverpot, dwarven peddler

## Gnolls

Description
Gnolls are large, hyena like beastmen with powerfully muscled
bodies. They tend to have orange, reddish, or yellow fur with black
spots or stripes. They have a mane of fur/hair running along their
heads, necks and down their back. With powerful jaws and strong
claws, the gnoll is a terrifying foe for whomever they run down.

### Society Placeholder

Intelligence: Moderate
Magic: Low
Social Status: Antisocial and violent
Threat Level: High

### Combat

Gnolls tend to attack in packs, or from secret, preferring to wound
and run down their prey over long periods of time, striking, then
slinking off until their sleepless prey are exhausted and worn to the
bone. Barbed arrows and spears made of bone or wood prone to
splintering or shattering within the prey are common weapons, as are
spiked whips or chained whips - they especially love the well made
weapons of the rakasha, and will purposely try to ambush weapon
traders from the south. These weapons are used to wound or bleed
their foes, which allows them to be tracked more easily. They are also
known to use a concoction of rotted blood and natural venoms to
make a potent poison they coat weapons with, causing delirium,
exhaustion, and hallucinations. Gnolls wear patchwork armor,
typically in a state of disrepair since they have little blacksmithing or
refined crafting skill.
Culture/Community
Gnolls are considered incredibly cruel and vicious by the standards of
most societies, frequently torturing captives to death, or eating them
alive. Most intelligent creatures would rather die then be captured
alive by gnolls, similar to the more bloodthirsty tribes of orcs.
Gnolls are travelling creatures, who maraud around the countryside,
before fleeing back into dangerous badlands to lay low from reprisal.
They are carnivores only, eating nothing but meat, and eat it raw.
Gnolls do not really keep possessions, beyond their weapons and
armor. They sleep on the ground in the open, huddled like a wild pack
of hyenas (often with a pack of actual hyenas.) They have a
language that is half learnable and half based on instinctual
understanding of meaning, so negotiations or even spying on them is
difficult.
Gnolls compete heavily with orcs for raiding and hunting territory. The
two species generally have a great emnity for each other.
Religon/Beliefs
Gnolls tend to exhibit worship of Malor, or worship Ashtar directly.
They often attempt blood magic, or channeling through fetishes, but
are unskilled and generally unsuccessful at doing so. However, they
frequently sacrifice living creatures to their gods, then eat the
remains. (I.e., everything that was not part of the sacrifice, typically
the heart.)

Quote

"We found the human settlers in the burnt out remains of their farm,
half eaten. A small gnoll raiding party, it appears they gorged
themselves on the adults and then took the smaller, easier to carry
children as supplies rather then spend time butchering them all. By
the time we found the young, our arrows were a mercy. I'll see them
in my nightmares for a long time - penace for letting that pack slip
through our forest."
 - Tia'loas Vreslelen, elvish strider

 ## Minotaurs

 Description
-Minotaurs are towering, heavily muscled brutes with the head and
lower body of a bull but the torso of a man. (Or more accurately, of an
ogre.) They typically have a thick mane of hair running down their
head, neck and back, and hair raning from sparse to thick covering
their bodies.
Combat
Minotaurs may attack in groups or alone. They usually rely on their
overwhelming strength, and like to wield weapons that allow them to
fully exploit it, with large crushing or cleaving weapons the most
common. They rarely enjoy fighting with thier fists, but are capable warriors with them, as well as trampling downed victims with their
solid, heavy hooves.

Intelligence: Moderate
Magic: Low
Social Status: Isolationist but open to trade
Threat Level: Low

Culture/Community
Minotaurs are relatively peaceful, as beastmen go. They do not eat
meat, and do not compete in most prime hunting areas. Despite their
relatively tremendous bulk, they seem to eat a disproportionately
small amount of food. However, they do not like to gather in large
groups or in large communities, tending to live in extremely small
clans in the northern Mist Isles, Overlook, or sir mountains. They
prefer cold weather climates to warm, though wandering clans have
been seen as far south as the Southern Kingdoms.
It is not unusual to find them temporarily in the service of humans as
bodyguards or workers. Typically, this is something they do when
they are younger. Female minotaurs are rarer, and competition for
their affection is high. Once a minotaur has claimed a mate, they tend
to mate for life, and remove themselves from the company of other
minotaurs and people.
Religon/Beliefs
Minotaurs do not have a strongly aligned racial heritage in religion.
Many of the Minotaurs of the north worship the elements, particularly
earth and water. The minotaurs inland, especially near humans,
typically worship human gods, with both Toren and Bane being
particularly popular in the northern kingdoms. However, many other
are secular, and simply do not care to consider the greater gods and
forces struggling around them. They are a practical people who often
are simply focusing on whatever is in front of them next.

"Hard to rouse their wrath, harder still to find the damn things in the
first place. Keep poking at em, and you'll get a true battle - smarter
than an ogre, strong as the dumb beasts they look like, and keep
fighting long after the ground is drenched dark in their blood. I'm
proud of the horns on my helm - Damn fine trophy."
 - Guldar Icebreaker, frost dwarf raider

 ## Gibberlings

 Description
A race of carnivorous humanoids that can be found both above and
beneath the surface of Icara, gibberlings are clawed, fanged,
mammailian humanoids with long, thick fur that typically grows thickly
on thier heads, necks and shoulders. Gibberlings have long talons on
both their hands and feet, which are typically dirty and caked with
gore. They usually stand around four and a half to six feet tall, though
it is hard to estimate their true height since they hunch down as they
run or walk.
Some gibberlings are smart enough to use the trappings of humanity,
covering themselves in scrap clothing or wrapping themselves in
cloth to appear clothed. They also will sometimes use crude tools.
Gibberlings occasionally will grow to great sizes. These gibberlings,
known as gibberling brutes, are terrifying and bloodthirsty monsters.
Unlike thier kin, their talons are usually worn to short and stubby
claws, since they use them to rend earth and trees while seeking their
prey. Other gibberlings will gather about them and scavenge from
their kills, though they risk becoming part of the brutes meals.

Intelligence: Low
Magic: None
Social Status: Antisocial and violent
Threat Level: High

Combat
Gibberlings tend to either swarm in packs or attempt to stealthily leap
upon a creature and drag it down into brush or tunnels to murder
alone. They attack in the dark at night where possible. Gibberlings
tend to try to overwhelm enemies quickly - if they cannot do so, they
will flee.
Culture/Community
Gibberlings have a strict societal structure based on hiearchy of
strength or viciousness. They rise in social structure by defeating or
driving off the creatures above them. Gibberlings typically cannot be
reasoned with, though they sometimes can be bribed or distracted
with food, or driven away with fire or loud noises. They are idiots.

Religon/Beliefs
They worship a full belly. They fear deadly foes. That's about as far
as any scholar would give them credit.

"Every time I scatter a pack of the murderous little apelings, I curse
whichever one of my cousins decided that it was a good idea to put a
book in the hands of one and spawn the human race. Putrid wastes
wallowing in their own filth - but they are funny if you set them on
fire."
 - Shylia Elestre, dark elf hunter


 ## Shakara

Description
Enormous tiger creatures that live in the southern jungles, Shakara
beastmen haunt old temples and places of blood and death. They
stand up to 8 or 9 feet tall, and have stripped fur and thick, powerful
bodies. Horns grow from their heads, like a rams or demons horns.
Shakara wear clothing or armor, and are intelligent creatures.

Intelligence: High
Magic: Moderate
Social Status: Dangerous and Isolationist
Threat Level: High


Combat
Shakara enjoy toying with their prey. They will stalk them over days,
heightening their fear and terror, stripping them of supplies, weapons,
and allies. It is not unusual for them to use magic or illusions to
further toy with their prey - they are especially fond of mirror image
and displacement spells. They will often talk with their prey before
they kill them - face to face if they feel far superior, or invisible or
otherwise concealed if not.
Culture/Community
Shakara don't have any obvious kinship for each other. They are
rarely if ever seen together. Their mating habits are obscure and
unknown. Thier motivations are hard to determine - they seem to
delight in the hunt, and in finding rare or obscure relics. But beyond
that, it's unknown. It has been speculated that Shakaras are the
planebound descendents of Rakshasa demons, or simply demons
from the realm of Malor given form.
Religon/Beliefs
Shakaras may worship any number of gods. Often they worship
none, or worship powerful fae or power devils or daemons. In other
words, their worship or lack of worship is as variable as any other
creature on Icara, though they tend to avoid celestials, which seem to
consider them impure.
