# Elemental Realms

An explanation of the primoridal (or elemental realms) that provide the fundamental building blocks and foundation of so many of Icara's other realms.

Fae elemental energy is considered by elven and elemental worshippers to be the lifeblood of Icara. All natural creatures, plants, and landscape are made up of various combinations of the six elements – water, earth, air, fire, light and shadow. An element is aligned with any element that it does not directly oppose it (meaning one of the two elements that is not directly across from it in the elemental wheel.) Opposing elements
cannot converge directly, but may through links to mutually aligned elements. 

Each of these elements has a dominion where it exists in a variety of forms, including the pure elemental dominion (an unsullied expression of the element at the heart of each dominion) and a variety of elemental realms composed of fusions between the pure element and sister elements. 

These impure elemental convergences form fae dominions– a dominion composed of multiple elements. Generally, these fae realms fall under the sway of one element dominion or another, and are considered part of those dominions. As dominions rise or ebb in power, these unstable fae-realms can fall apart, destroying or relocating objects within to an elemental dominion as they are re-absorbed. Where all the elemental dominions converge, it creates a Primal dominion, a balanced fusion of elemental energies. This includes the Fae Realm, a magical realm that spans to connect all elemental dominions. It also includes the Prime Realm, the most stable of the primal dominions, otherwise known as Icara.

## ELEMENTAL MAGIC AND FAE-PATHS BETWEEN REALMS

The various Fae Realms and Dominions are connected through elemental energy. Fae and elementals tap into this energy naturally, as instinctually as a creature breathes or moves. Sorcerers and arcane casters can learn to tap into this energy, and often do…Elemental magic is the easiest magic to call upon, as it can be gathered directly from the primal dominions. It is stronger near elemental founts – magical conduits of energy where the primal dominion ties to a fae dominion, or in rare instances, directly to an elemental dominion.

These are called fae paths, and for those who understand elemental magic, these paths can be used to travel between dominions and realms. These paths may be tenuous or strong, much like fae dominion themselves, and may be a path in name only. Unless a path is well known, travelers are warned to avoid dawdling, as it can collapse the same as any fae realm, and there is no way to telling what manner of fae or elemental traveler may be found roaming the roads between realms. These paths tends to connect one elemental fount to another.

## THE FAE COURTS

The elemental dominions of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air are ruled by the Fae. The reason that the fae rule these lands instead of the purer elementals is simple – while elementals (especially elementals on their own plane) are just as powerful as the Fae, the elemental Fae are infinitely more clever, more organized, and more ambitious.

To pass their eternity, powerful fae align in a variety of hierarchies, both strict and convoluted. Weaker fae tend to follow stronger fae, as an eternal being can torment a lesser eternal being any number of ways. They love games, riddles, wars, intrigue, and any number of other distractions to pass their time. The strongest of the fae have created the Fae Courts - powerful contingents of fae that have claimed ownership of the most habitable land in the Fae and Elemental realms. 

These fae gather support from both other fae and mortal worshippers to engage in various power games between each other and against the Fae Courts in other realms. The Fae Courts in any specific dominion are ruled by the Fae most closely aligned with the elements in that dominion, as that is where their power is the strongest. The farther a fae travels from its dominion, the weaker it becomes, depending on how many realms removed it is. 

The two elemental dominions that this seems to be untrue in are the Dominions of Light and Shadow – no courts exists in those dominions. Some speculate this is because the pure elementals of the respective dominion are especially savage – others state that while all the dominions have hazardous expressions of the pure element, the elemental dominions of light and shadow are especially hard on impure creatures. However, many fae (and mortals!) reach into these dominions to utilize their elemental energies, or travel the fae paths in through these realms.

The four Fae courts are The Court of Storms, the Fae court of the skies, thunder and lightning, and the eternal enemies of the earth aligned fae and their agents. The Court of Frost, a demanding court of cold, hard fae who extoll sacrifice, self denial, and mercilessness from their agents, The Court of Flames, with passionate, hot tempered fire-fae bending mortals to their hedonistic lifestyle, and The Court of Stone - the patient, stubborn, and inexorable fae who oppose the whimsical fae of the court of storms.

## ELEMENTALS AND FAE IN THE PRIME DOMINION

Fae are both common occurrences throughout the realms, and many have made permanent homes in the realm of Icara. Elementals can also be found throughout Icara, but typically are not there by choice. Fae typically can be found gathering near elemental founts, but there are many fae that just naturally exist in the world, wandering it as if they were native creatures. Fae often have inherent magical abilities. There are other creatures that are clear descendants of Fae - these creatures may share an affinity for one or more elements, or have some innate supernatural talent.

Elves believe that they are fae, and many people believe that dwarfs are fae as well, due to their extended lifespan.
