The land of Icara is ringed on all sides by magical bonds and pathways to outside realms. Many of these magical bonds are with the Elemental planes, where energy is drawn freely from one elemental or fae font into the world of Icara. Often, fae pathways can be found alongside these fonts, leading either to another font in Icara or to a Fae Realm.

Other pathways have been forged by magic-users to the Eternal Realms. The Eternal Realms exist on other planes, lands that have been warred over for eons by powerful immortal entities and their followers. These immortals call upon the souls and faith of their faithful to gain ever more power, and then use this power to expand their own influence and power.
