# Styles of Magic

Every caster must create their own connection with the various magical energies that make up the world. How a mage interacts with the magic available both within their own body and within the world around them makes all the difference in how they can cast spells.

The mental discipline or force of will needed to focus that power comes from within. So magic itself is quite personal - a wizard can teach you how they call forth a campfire, but the same runes read aloud with the same gestures repeated might do nothing, or light the erstwhile student aflame. 

In other words, magic is very much an art, one that each artist must navigate largely on their own, depending on their own understanding and personal relationship with their medium.

## Arcane Casting

Arcane casting is learned magic - Arcane casting was created by the Sun elves, as they attempted to find a way to help the humans, dwarves and orcs get in touch with the fae magic that came naturally to the children of the elements. In doing so, however, they learned of many other types of power that could be accessed.

### Metoc Magic

The magic that was first taught to the humans and the dwarves by the Sun Elves back in the Second Age, and the most common magic practiced by the wizards of the world. The wise elves knew that few creatures had as much magic in their veins as them, and so instead of trying to teach them magic as they cast it, the Sun Elves developed a way for other creatures to call magic to them, with words, and then gather it, with words or signs, and then bind it to a focus or component of like nature or power. Then, magic bound, the wizard could release the magic with the spoken phrases or arcane signals of power that commanded magical energy.

This style of casting had an unexpected side effect - By using like to like, and binding magic, elves discovered they themselves could use magics they had never known. This eventually led them beyond the magics that were nature of the fae, and to the other arcane disciplines. 

All spells are unique to a caster - only the caster can learn exactly what he must do to gather magic. What
works for one wizard may well not work for another, for that wizard may have a different bloodline, or different strength, or a different understanding of magic. Even with books passed down, each wizard must reinterpret the runes differently to make them work with his unique essence.

The exact casting requirements of Metoc magic is dependent on both the power of the spell and the power of the caster. The more powerful the caster, the easier and faster each step is. Conversely, the more powerful the magic, the harder and slower each of these steps are. It is not uncommon for many casters together to join together to strengthen their ritual castings. Metoc magic is the most commonly cast magic in Icara.

*The old man sighed heavily, as he came to the deadends. He knew this was where it was - the way must be hidden. Reaching into a leather pouch at his side, he pulled out a handful of dandelion seeds. Whispering softly, he murmurs the words that call upon wind and sight, signing sigils into the air with one hand to give the magic something to gather into. When he felt enough power gathered, he brings the cupped dandelion seeds to his still signing hand, and opens his palm flat. With a whoosh, all the magic flares into the seeds and sends them dancing through the air, glowing in the warm summer night. Without fail they line a hidden door, the light gleaming from them. With a smile and a nod, the wizard ambled to the door, and tapped it with his staff. The door swung open with a creak.*

- **Power Source:** Natural and Supernatural sources
- **Common Casters:** The races of law - humans, dwarves, elves, rakasha, dynastan, and sauren.
- **Casting Requirements:** All Metoc magic have these Casting components:
    - **Calling** - The verbal casting - Words, songs, phrases or sounds repeated in special order, cadence and volume to capture and draw magic in.
    - **Binding** - The physical casting - Symbols, gestures and actions that bind the magic to be cast. This magic is generally bound to ONE to TWO of the following:
        - **focus** (an item prepared or specially suited to hold magical energy)
        - **reagent** (material to be consumed in casting)
        - **leysign** (an invisible sigil traced in the air)
        - **rune** (a symbol carved or written onto a physical object)
    - **Epoch** - The release or completion of the spell - A word, phrase or gesture (sometimes both) that release the magical energy to complete whatever effect is intended.

### Dire Magic

The rules of magic filtered not only to the humans, but also the greenbloods, the beastmen, and the other tribes of the land. However, they could not quite master the same spells that the humans could...it seemed to take them longer to cast, and certain energies seemed to not respond. However, they could gather power from fire and earth, and both responded well to the more simplistic runes and symbols used by the tribal peoples.

Dire magic is loud, often performed by screaming or yelling out incantations, and this power is harnessed by sketching large symbols onto the ground - either by actually drawing them into the dirt, or by scraping them out on whatever surface is in the way. Some casters cannot actually complete the spell unless they have dirt to carve a symbol into, and these tend to be cautious enough to keep bags of dirt on hand, to cast over the ground they must draw their runes. This is done by hand or by staff, as such, many such castings are done on the knees. It is for this reason that more sophisticated casters will refer to this as mud magic. A dire caster will always have a focus, or multiple focuses - carefully crafted conduits of magical power, and reagents to sacrifice to the spell. 

Dire Magic, like Metoc magic, requires both substantial calling, binding and releasing steps. Dire Magic is cast slowly, however, often taking two, three, or even five times the casting time of a similar Metoc spell, because of the size of the symbols drawn, and because the loud enunciation of the castings. Because of this, dire casters tend to be slower than their peers. They also tend to be able to cast fewer times before reaching exhaustion. On the other hand, the extra time gathers quite a bit of power, and the spells cast by dire casters are generally big and powerful, if unfocused. One of the reasons it is so exhaustive with the shamans who use it is because it is powerful, if limited.

*The goblins rushed forward, squealing in glee as they scrambled to the stone farmhouse. Inside, the small group of neighbors tightly gripped the farm implements they had snatched while fleeing. They could hear the creatures clambering up the walls and beating on the doors, but it was a well built storage facility, and it held. Then they heard the wail. A high, keening sound, repeated again and again. Peeking outside, they could see a goblin stamping about angrily, gnashing his teeth. Dropping to his knees, the creature dragged his dirty hands into the earth, before springing up again and making the same godawful sound. He seemed crazy, but as it continued, a new sound rose above the sounds of goblins beating on the stones and door - a rumbling sound. With a final, frenzied scream, the goblin hurled fistfuls of dirt at the door, and though they scattered in air, the walls buckled and the door blasted to kindling as if struck by a stone giant, shredding bits of wood and stone ripping into those planting themselves in front of the door. As the bloody defenders fell away from the gaping hole that had once been their wall, shrieking goblins poured in...and the screams drowned out the shrieks.*

- **Power Sources:** Natural (Elemental, Essence, Aurae, Vitae)
- **Common Casters:** Orcs, goblins, ogres, kobolds, minotaurs.
- **Casting Requirements:** Verbal, Somatic, Material
    - **Gather** - Verbal and Physical casting - Keening high pitched screaming, or deep guttural roars, pleading with physical gestures or other dramatic actions to help attract and gather the magic.
    - **Imbue** - physical casting - Runes and Sigils drawn in the dirt or along the floor, with stamping of feet or pounding of fists around the sigils to complete the binding. Dire Magic will contain all three of these components:
        - **focus** (an item prepared or specially suited to hold magical energy)
        - **reagent** (material to be consumed in casting)
        - **rune** (a symbol carved or written onto a physical object) or **leysign** (symbols drawn onto the ground or physical object)
    - **Exhortion** - Release or completion of the spell - An intensely loud scream designed to release the magic in the intended way.

### Blood Magic

Deep in the south, the coldblood creatures formed their own magics. Blind to the powerful flow of ley energy from the realms of the fae, these creatures instead craft the life energy of creatures into fearsome spells, hexes and charms. This magic was mastered by the coldbloods, specifically the Tekutli of the Asyrillian empire, in addition to the demonic rakshasa and shakara. Slowly, this magic made its way north, until the humans of the Southern and Western Kingdoms began to practice it in the Second Age.

Blood magic does not require a call, as the magic is already present and bound in the life energy it is being
harvested from. Blood magic only requires the spell be shaped once the bloodletting has begun. However, it is not uncommon for shaping to begin prior to the harvest, especially if the amount of blood being harvested is slight.

Blood magic is quite powerful, and can be used in many different ways. Some practitioners of blood magic do so because of the reliability, sacrificing their own blood for a small desired effect. The healing powers of life are immense, should one be willing to sacrifice their own life essence to repair that of another. Others use brutal sacrifice, releasing massive amounts of power that can be channeled to their will by slaying others, sometimes many others, and then powering their own magic with the life energy stolen from those murders.

While blood magic was rumored to be developed by southern sorcerers, it is used across Icara, causing some to speculate that it has always been practiced by ancient mages and sorcerers. Blood magic is wildly popular with beastmen magic users, especially those that seem to be unable to call elemental magic, and was adopted by many orcish tribes as well. However, many creatures are unable to use blood magic effectively, and practitioners of blood magic are typically treated to execution in the lands of law. Dynastan specifically hold no trust for the users of blood magic, the wicked art of their most hated enemies.

*The robed figures circled the young man on the pedestal, golden masks fixed firmly to their face. Their identities were a secret, not just to the shaking figure laying on the cold marble, but also each other. The penalty for blood magic in Uruthia was sure - burning in the pit, so the tainted blood would not be harvested and no trace of witchcraft could remain.*

*The young prince had been taken in the night by the shadows, true believers who knew the importance of shaping the realms future. What a weak and sickly thing he was. They doubted his tight bonds were necessary, any one of them could probably hold him down. The northern point of the pentagon drew a silver blade, holding it high in the air, and the chanting began. Each of the robed figures held up their own blade. Copper. Bronze. Gold. Iron. While chanting, each drew the blade cleanly through their palms, and placed the bleeding hands onto the pedestal.*

*The cold marble flared with light, warmth emanating in all directions. When the light had faded, the figures hung heavily from the table, barely able to hold themselves up. The prince on the table was no longer shaking - his ailment was cured. The shadows would return him to the castle, and none would be the wiser - but the bloodline was purified, and Uruthia would stand strong for another generation.*

- **Power Source:** Vitality
- **Common Casters:** Orcs, Gnolls, Tekutli, Credellian, Shakara, Humans, Elves
- **Casting Requirements:** Verbal OR Somatic
    - **Harvest** - releasing the blood or lifeforce being utilized. If the lifeforce is already released, or being released by another, this step is not necessary for the caster.
    - **Shaping** - motions or words that activate the magic.

### Astral Magic

As humans learned to breach the walls between realms, they gained access to new, dangerous forms of power. The Eternal realms (Astral Sea, Astral Void, High Heavens, Fallen Realms, Circles of Hell, and Abyss) give an immense variety and depth of different kinds of energy, power and study. In addition, practitioners of rift magic can directly access the various Fae dimensions, instead of relying on the ley lines or elemental fonts of power to provide the necessary energy.

However, the downsides to using the magic from another realm are numerous. The rift must be created, either by using another form of magic, or by a maintained connection. Therefore, magic users relying on rift magic must either cast multiple spells to receive their intended affect, or they must cast from a stationery location, where they are already maintaining this connection.

Rift magic is fairly impractical for most mages, but incredibly strong if used correctly. With it, sages and
magi are slowly unlocking the secrets of gods and devils, and mimicking the powerful magic they grant to their followers. A rift mage must ever be careful that they do not bring something unintended back with them
from the other realms, however, and be careful to seal the rifts they create.

*The mercenaries crashed through the heavy oaken door to the spire, blades ready. "Lotharis! You are to be seized to stand trial for crimes against the town of Hayswerd! Lay down your arms!"*

*However, the human standing before them amidst floating shards of crystal is unarmed. As they surge forward, the crystals begin to spin in large circular orbits. "You fools. I offered the people of Hayswerd my protection, and they repay me by assaulting me in my home." A crackling yellow energy flared from the crystals, and a beam of white power scattered the invaders, searing two of them to blackened ash instantly. Outside of the circle of spinning shards, blackness seeps out of the floorboards and stone walls. "Pay the price of your treachery!"*

*The living soldiers dropped to the floor, trying to gag, but the necrotic energy filling them would not be expelled. Slowly, they twisted up in hideous animations of richtus pain, limbs bent awkwardly and frozen mid death spasm. Laughing to himself, Lotharis banished the fel energy, and strode from his chamber. Now to deal with those ingrates in Hayswerd.*

- **Power Source:** Planar Rifts
- **Common Casters:** Humans, elves
- **Casting Requirements:** Verbal, Somatic, Material
    - **Contact** - A spell to open a gateway between this world and another. This often requires a pre-existing focus with carefully created runes.


## Channeling

Channeling casting is different then arcane casting. A channeler does not learn magic in the manner that a wizard does - instead, a channeler is shapes the magic that is around them. 

Channeling was the original form of magic - elves channeled the fae powers that were at the core of their being, casting what came natural to them. After the wars with the dwarves started, elves began to dig deeper,  so that they may create the spells they needed to counteract the dangerous dwarven menace.

### Sorcerer Channeling

### Bardic Channeling

### Manifestation

The final form of casting is not really casting as much as it is using magic that is already present in the user. Manifestation is most prevalent with magical beings, such as angels, devils, and demons. Manifestation requires no words, no symbols, it is just something that happens. It is obvious when a dragon breaths fire, or a demon raises hellfire, but many other forms of lesser manifestation are also magical - such as a trolls remarkable regeneration, or the growth of a dryad grove. 

The most famous of the manifestations is that of the true dragons. Dragons are beings that seem to be comprised of pure arcane energy - and their ability to understand spells on a fundamental level is unmatched. Dragons will study spells if the urge takes them, and then recreate them with a thought. Even complicated rift rituals or multicaster spells do not seem too difficult for them.

Very few creatures have this similar abilities - but the closest appear to be in the most unlikely of creatures, the diminutive trueblood sauren. These creatures will often learn spells at a primal level, and cast them with little or no physical evidence of casting.
