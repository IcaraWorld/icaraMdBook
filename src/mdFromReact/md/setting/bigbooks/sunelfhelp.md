# Sun Elves Helping Others

"Man, these new 'dwarf' things sure don't get along with our Moon Elf brethren. Do you think we could make it better somehow?"

"Well, I guess we don't need our land, we'll cede it to the dwarves and move south so there aren't any needs for territory wars up north."

"Fuck, the dwarves used our land to dig in and establish overland fortresses they could use to wage war on the Moon Elves to pillage their resources. Our bad, fam."

"Well, we tried. Speaking of trying, these human and orc tribes seem like they have a hard life. We could ease the suffering here a lot just by teaching them a few basic building and crafting techniques so they can start a proper civilization." 

"Why stop there? Let's teach them fae magic. That way they can help us restore the land and beasts, we can't be everywhere at once."

"Holy shit. The orcs that learned it have all become cult leaders and are just using it to wage war on everyone around them and kill shit. Cool."

"Oh fuck, humans are using magic to rip open portals to other worlds. What are these called? 'Demons?'" 

"The humans are conquering and building all across the entire north.....are we?"

"Yep. We'll head south to the middle of the continent this time."

"Man, these southern plains are dangerous. There sure are a lot of beast people tribes here living in primitive degenerate chaos."

"Maybe we should just try to teach responsible uses of crafting to these beast creatures so they can farm and settle down. It's the one part of civilizing the northern races that worked."

"Oh, awesome, they became marauding warbands now that they understand iron and tools, and they have no interest in farming because they are like 90% meat eater. But they sure love to kill!"

"Fuck it, let's move into the southern jungles."

"Oh shit, these poor creatures down here are enslaved to dark and evil magic. Maybe we should...."

"GOD FUCKING DAMN IT, WE'RE OUT OF CONTINENT. WE'RE NOT HELPING ANYONE ELSE."

"Ok, ok, but hear me out! What if we don't GIVE them anything, we just FREE them from the bonds of slavery and then stay out of it?"

"......."

"I mean, we at very least believe in liberty, right?"

".....fine. But be careful."

"Ahem....so....we freed them...."

"Seriously? Did the one enslaved race we free just become the dominant species and enslave literally EVERYTHING else in the jungle? And now they're marching north?"

"I mean......"

"I don't want to live on this planet anymore."
