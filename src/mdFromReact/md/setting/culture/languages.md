| Common | This universal tongue is a collection of words from the tradetongues of various peoples. As they grew together, they created a mishmash of a language. Common is effective, but it can be clunky and slow to speak, with speakers often trying multiple regional or dialect specific "versions" of words to be fully understood. Most people would prefer to speak in their native language or a local tradetongue. | Metoc, Stonespeak, Mooryu, Hightongue |
| Metoc | People of the Western Kingdoms (Elven tradetongue). The language that the elves taught the humans and orcish peoples at the Enlightenment, and passed onto their generations.
