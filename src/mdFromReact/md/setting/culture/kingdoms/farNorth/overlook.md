# Overlook

## Geography 

The Overlook is the long stretch of highland along the coastline just underneath the Mjorn Tundra and extending to the mouth of the Nijierasill river. Mountainous and rocky, with poor agricultural soil and unforgiving winter temperatures gusting from the glacier and mountains to the north and east, and freezing mist rising from the Sea of Shards make this an inhospitable and harsh place. However, unlike the tundra above it, the seasons do allow for a growing season for hearty crops, and the low temperature allows for natural long storage of meats, cheeses, vegetables, or other forage. The land has been carved by moving glaciers, and the cliffs are high and scarred from many centuries of the frozen waves smashing against them.

## Civilization

Overlook is the home of a number of human tribes, and some dwarven settlements that have drifted down from the tundra. Most of the highland people are herders, although fishing is sometimes done during the summer months (mostly by the frost dwarves, who are much more adept at sailing the Sea of Shards.) The relationship between the dwarves and humans is volatile, occasionally they are allies, and occasionally violent foes. For the most part, these are simple people, due to the sparse population and lack of valuable resources along the storm racked coasts.
