# Mjorn Tundra

## Geography

The Mjorn Tundra is a frozen wasteland extending from the northwest corner of the continent deep into the Alinsaer Sea. It is separated from the
rest of the continent by a tremendous eastern glacier, considered completely impassable by landlocked and mortal creatures, due not only to the natural dangers of attempting to cross a sub-zero glacial fracture zone with numerous chasms and crevasses, but also due to the dangerous elemental fae, draconic, and other frost based monsters that make the glacier their home. To the northeast, north and west it is surrounded by the Alinsaer Sea, and to the south is the Sea of Shards.

The tundra itself is afflicted by permafrost, with little vegetation growing, and only during the summer months. It is characterized by constant freezing winds, barren, frozen plains and hills, and little to no precipitation (plants grow during the summer as the top layer of permafrost melts, forming lakes and marshlands, and then dies again in the winter months during refreeze.)

## Civilizations

There is a very small civilized population here. Frost dwarves, frost giants and other titans races make up the population, all of which tend to live
in nomadic groups which live in clans or tribes. There are some larger semi-permanent settlements that have been formed along the coast of the sea of shards, typically populated by dwarven clans who gather there to raid the port kingdoms to the south during the summer months when the Sea of Shards can be more easily traversed. There are also fortresses that multiple clans can gather in during times of war, but these are not typically occupied as there is too little food to support large centralized populations.
