# Aesir Mountains

## Geography

The Aesir mountains are the head of a mountain range that span thousands of miles, splitting the continent along its eastern edge from the far north
all the way down to the shores of the southern continent. The mountain range is referred by different names as it winds south, but is commonly referred by the civilized populations of Icara as the Aesir mountains collectively, and also to describe the dwarf and titan dominated northern mountains. The elevation is quite a bit above sea level, and includes within its western fringes the riverhead of the Nijierasill, a tremendous upwelling of water
that flows west across the continent until it reaches the ocean.

The enormous mountain range is filled with highlands, valleys, and mountain passes, and the climate is sub-artic, ranging from freezing winters to temperate during certain parts of the year. The mountains themselves are still active, despite their age, with tectonic forces slowly shifting spires
higher, though the activity is much slower and more predictable in the northern parts of the range. High cliffs, spires, and peaks, as well as numerous caves and chasms are the result. Minor volcanic activity can lead to pockets of much warmer terrain, both above and beneath the surface. Major volcanic eruptions here are rare, as the tectonic pressure is being constantly alleviated by much slower and gradual movement.

## Civilization 

The great variation in terrain and temperature supports an wide variety of flora and fauna, which in turn lend themselves to a surprising number of densely packed civilizations. The Aesir mountains have a huge number of cave orc, goblin, and ogre tribes packed within the caves and tunnels that run through them, quite a few human and titan tribes roaming the highlands and valleys throughout the range, and the oldest dwarven kingdoms in Icara ruling both. This leads to constant territorial skirmishes, as each group is eager to preserve that which theyâ€™ve laid out, and shifting mountain features or population increases are forever causing the need to expand or replace territory. 

Mountain dwarves are the densest of the civilized creatures, though there may be many more goblins, orcs and ogres, these population groups tend to be spread over many more tribes, and do not hold the political or military clout of the well-organized dwarven kingdoms. Titan clans, while powerful in their own right, are limited in scope and population, and therefore do not hold much sway outside of their immediate areas of control. Only a fool would travel the hotly contested lands lightly, however, due to the various factions fighting for space and the deadly natural conditions.
