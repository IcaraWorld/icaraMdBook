# Elven Great Forest

## Geography

Sitting atop the civilized realms like a crown, the high and wood elven dominated Great Forest spans a huge expanse of territory. The woods are contained by the icy waters of the Alinsaer Sea that surrounds the top of the continent and the vast, swift moving Nijierasill river that cuts between
the forest and the human lands beneath it. The forest is bracketed on each side, by the sir mountain range in the east, the great glacial walls of the Mjorn tundra in the west. As the name implies, it is heavily forested throughout, and despite being quite far north and ringed on three sides by bone-chillingly cold lands, it remains a very temperate realm at the heart of the forest, with hot summers and long falls and springs. All manner of
vegetation and wildlife can be found within its borders, of both an earthly and unearthly nature.

In the heart of the forest, a massive oak tree towers over the rest of the vegetation, the fae-blessed Worldtree, growing in the even more massive burnt out husk of the sacred tree that grew from the dawn of time until its destruction during the Fourth Age. Once known as the Worldtree, this massive shell of a stump is now more commonly referred to as the Tree of the Goddess. Elven legend states it is this tree that protects the forest from the harsh weather that exists all around the forest, and provides sanctuary for the blessed of Tyra, the elvish goddess of Nature. It supposedly grows in both the physical plane and the fae-realms simultaneously.

## Civilizations

It isn’t called the elvish forest ironically. This may be largest known population center for the fae race, the vast majority of them are High elves and Wood elves, with the remaining a mix of Dark, Gray, and Sun elves. There are also always a very small population of accepted diplomats and visitors, from dwarven, human, Dynastan, sauren and rakasha races. These, however, are minimal at best, as the Wood elf population considers the forest a sacred realm and will often kill visitors. If these conflicts escalate, the hosting High elves usually will be quick to remove the offending races. There is rarely anything akin to justice for a non-elf killed within the elvish forest, so few are eager to visit the place. 

Beyond the elves, the forest is home to numerous other wild and fae creatures, such as dryads, nymphs, centaurs, satyrs, faeries, sylphs and a host of other elemental or fae creatures. The temperate nature of the forest itself supports a huge host of life, and the magical nature of the land lends to fantastic creatures as well as the mundane. There are multiple natural, sustained portals to the Fae realms within the Elvish forest, as well as multiple fae paths to other parts of the world.

A variety of large elven cities are scattered throughout this realm, but the majority of the population lives in small close knit communities throughout the forest. These may be either high elven or wood elf communities. The high elves rule the cities and civilized realms. The wood elves typically hold sway in the “wilds” of the forest, though almost all the forest would be considered wilds by non-elves.
