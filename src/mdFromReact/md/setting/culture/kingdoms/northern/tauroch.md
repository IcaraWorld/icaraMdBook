# Oligarchy of Tauroch

## Geography

A smaller kingdom on the edges of the Uruthian empire, this land shares the low elevations, wooded areas and plains of its northern neighbor.

## Civilization

Originally a barony that broke away from the Uruthian empire, Tauroch reinvented itself as an oligarchy under the rule of powerful merchant houses to help protect against encroachment by the Kingdom of the Three Rings. Tauroch is more diverse than its neighbors, though it is still predominantly human. However, it is not uncommon to see elves, dwarves, rakasha, Dynastan, sauren, or orcs. Additionally, orcish tribes are more likely to be found traveling in this area, since the kingdom doesnâ€™t exercise the same control within its borders that the surrounding kingdoms do, and it is near frontier lands in which nomadic tribes frequently travel.
