# Entarian Frontier

## Geography

The Entarian frontier is tucked against the sir mountains to the east and the Nijierasill river to the north. To the west is the Deurgan kingdoms and to the south is the Eastern Crescent. The land itself, much like Deurgan, is worn and overworked, though it was once a bountiful land rich in resources.


## Civilization

Once the kingdom of Entaria, this land was a rich trading partner of the elven and dwarven kingdoms to the north, taking advantage of the single traversable land bridge over the Nijierasill that didnâ€™t involve travelling the dangerous sir mountain range. Unfortunately, the capital cities were sacked by an orcish army from the Forged Lands, and the resulting series of raids from numerous barbarian tribes have left the land little more than a handful of fortresses run by the merchants of the Skelur oligarchy. Without being able to defend the roads, trade has been deadened considerably, with much of the traffic now headed from the Eastern Crescent to Tarajah along the Silk Road, and then north by the Golden Road up to the Uruthian Empire. These lands are overrun with barbarian tribes and smugglers looking to pass contraband through to the Elven forest and dwarven kingdoms
