# Resa 

## Geography

Resa is a region of multiple landscapes. Large mountain ranges, deeps woods, plains and rivers make up the common features of this large kingdom. It is ringed by the Ukerian Frontier to the north and west, and Tarajahan desert to the southwest, and the edges of the eastern crescent to the south. To the east is the kingdom of Deurgan.

## Civilization

The ruling king calls his kingdom the empire of Resa, but it does match the breadth or span of lands commonly considered empires, such as the Uruthian empire to the west and the Dynastan empire far to the south. However, it is an expansive kingdom, and it does include another entire kingdom (Djomenheim) of dwarves that was subsumed and annexed from the Ukerian UnderEarth kingdoms. Beyond them, the kingdom of Resa is a kingdom of humans.  Resa is united under one king and one god, and has little tolerance for interference from other ruling influences.
