# Kingdom of the Three Rings

## Geography

The kingdom of the Three Rings exists just to the southeast of the Uruthian empire. This land shares the low elevations, wooded areas and plains
of its northern neighbor.

## Civilization

Once a series of baronies with ties to the empire, four ambitious kingdoms broke away as a united nation. These human nations slowly pulled apart into four separate kingdoms, and the 3 smaller kingdoms, the Baronies of Suldred, Morakar, and Antioch, became theocracies reunited under the rule of the priesthood of Bane. The population is primarily human, though some elves and orcish live or pass within their borders.
