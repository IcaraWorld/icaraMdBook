# Deurgan Kingdom

## Geography

The kingdom of Deurgan is predominantly plains, hills and mountains. It has large forests at one point, but its forested area has been overhunted and over logged, and they are not healthy. The kingdom otherwise shares the features of other northern kingdoms.


## Civilization

Deurgan is predominantly human, but has a large contingent of nonhumans as well (dwarves, rakasha, Dynastan, orcs). The kingdom itself is dying, as much of its trade used to flow from the Eastern crescent upward through the elven and dwarven empires. However, Resa has turned inwards, restricting trade, and the Skelur oligarchy has turned to trading directly through the Eastern crescent to try to ensure its own survival in the wake of the collapse of the Entarian kingdom. The area is restless, and has become a haven for mercenaries operating across the north.
