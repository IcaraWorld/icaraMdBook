# Uruthian Empire

## Geography 

The empire of Uruth is a large area of land centralized above the Tarajahan desert. It primarily consists of plains below 150 feet in elevation, with small hills, woodlands and forested area. It is very temperate, and contains multiple rivers flowing from the Nijierasill that provides both water for seasonal plant life and abundant freshwater fish and marine animals. The weather is seasonal, with cold winters, cool falls, warm springs and hot summers, lending itself to a wide range of natural plants and a wide variety of seasonal crops. 

## Civilizations

The rich natural resources of this land lead to it to becoming a densely populated, highly developed center of civilization. It is believed to have
been one of the first human civilizations and kingdoms, part of the Metoc kingdoms formed by the Elder races. Throughout the age of blood, these human kingdom vied for control, until a single king eventually consolidated all of the surrounding kingdoms into a mighty human empire during the Third Age, a kingdom that has lasted in one form or another until today. Multiple noble families have held power and claimed lineage dating back to the empires founder, and these noble houses compete for power and land amongst each other. The vast majority of the citizens of the Uruthian empire are human, there are a large number of dwarven, elven and rakasha citizens or communities. To a smaller degree, there are tribes of orcs, wood elves living in the area, but the Uruthian Empire is capable of boasting huge armies of trained warriors from the noble houses, allowing relatively strong policing of internal threats. The Golden Road runs into the Uruthian Empire, and they export goods and services to the kingdoms to the south of them through it.
