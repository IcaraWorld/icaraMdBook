# Avelos Kingdom

## Geography

Avelos is the center of a grouping of lands northwest of the Uruthian Empire, running along the river-cut cliffs of the Nijierasill. It branches into various parts of the western coastline as well as east into the Uruthian empire. Avelos is heavily forested, and subsists mostly of rolling hills covered in dense woodlands. As such, it is not ideal for farming compared to the rich plains of its eastern neighbor, but it is still rich in plant and animal life.

## Civilization

Avelos is ruled by high elves that have taken it upon themselves to establish a kingdom and aristocracy. Avelos considers itself a point of contact and negotiation between the elven lands and the human lands. They are a primary point of trade between the Northern kingdoms and the elves, with many human nations enjoying the exotic thrill of dealing with elven aristocrats. The elven nation considers them akin to humans for the most part, since theyâ€™ve adopted so many human ways. Humans live and trade within the kingdom, and can even be granted knighthood and land, but the title dies with the human, and cannot be passed to their heirs. In this way the Kingdom of Avelos preserves its elvish heritage while still availing itself to the resources of human labor, soldiers, and loyalty.
