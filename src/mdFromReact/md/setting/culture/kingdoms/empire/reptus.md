# Reptus Provincia

An elongated stretch of jungle, coastline, and sea curving along the western coast and north western border of the Dynastan Empire, until it merges into the Sharake Provincia, the Reptus Provincia contains a slightly less precipitation and is not quite as hot as the jungles inland.

The Reptus legate of this provincia concentrates heavily on agricultural production and trade acquisition, since he controls some of the strongest trade routes into the Empire. Sugarcane plantations are tiered throughout the jungles, and the local administrators are quick to hire professionals from the north to manage their agricultural pursuits. The coastal city Ascalon stands as a multicultural beacon in the otherwise Dynastan dominated empire, where traders from up and down the coast of Icara can gather to safely trade with the Empire. Unfortunately, so much of the attention, both mercantile and military, is concentrated along the sea coast, that the northern borders has become something of a loosely controlled frontier, with little imperial interference with the local rulers or magistratus. Unfortunately, this can lead to semi-serious border clashes with the southern kingdoms that are desperately trying to hold onto their land, and already live in perpetual fear that the Empire will decide to spill back north.
