# Sharake Provincia

Sharake contains the wild country encountered directly out of the jungle, a temperate forest interspersed with densely vegetated plains and ravines. It stretches along the north eastern section of the empire, curving north at the point it reaches the sir mountains, and reaching up to just below the Drasis kingdoms. While the rainfall here is significant for a temperate zone, it is much less pronounced than in the southern provincias.

This was mostly frontier, so even though some of the human kingdoms conquered in the initial Dynastan press are still under Dynastan control the northern alliances were not willing to continue pushing the empire to take what amounted to wilderness at the end of the Fifth Age. The legate of Sharake rules over a mixed provincia of humans, elves, dwarves, and Dynastan. The rights of slave ownership often come into question here, as Dynastan will still enforce ownership of slaves, but there is a well developed network within Sharake to spirit away privately owned humanoids. Unlike its sister provincia Reptus, the borders between the southern kingdoms and northern Empire are well policed and diplomatically governed, with every effort made to integrate cultural differences between the “lesser” races and the dragonkin.
