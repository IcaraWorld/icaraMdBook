# Imperium Provincia

The Imperium rests deep on the southern continent, in an intensely hot tropical land of dense jungles, rich marshlands, and constant rainfall. The occasional mountain peak rises up through the jungle canopy, and wide rivers cut the deep green with streaks of sparkling blue, but most of the terrain is nigh impenetrable jungle foliage.

Vrudex Arcis, the Divine Seat of the Dynastan Empire, consists of five massive cities that tower over the surrounding jungles. Huge obelisks containing the worshipers of Sylith, massive cathedrals that contain the magistratus of Tyranus, castles built inside the city walls themselves to house the noble bloodlines descending from Drakenâ€¦The Vrudex Arcis, from wall to wall, may be the only urban center of greater size than Tarajah itself. The cities were built on demolished mountain peaks, with great bridges spanning between them, with the wicked, untamed jungles below. The roars of the dinosaurs, dragoths, and other mighty predators of the intensely hot prehistoric rainforests of the deep jungle echo over the cities. Dynastan rule here, with subjects of all races. While enslavement of other sentient races has been publicly dropped by many Dynastan cultures near other kingdoms, in the heart of the Dynastan Empire it has yet to be curtailed in any meaningful way, as the Dynastan nobles play power games to try and ensure the next Emperor is from their bloodline.
