# Colandar Republic

Colander is primarily grassy plainsland, interspersed with a few hilly and forested regions, stretching from outside the Tarajahn desert toward the Aesir mountains. The vegetation in this part of the Eastern Crescent is basically brushland, with hot summers and cold winters. 

The Colander republic is a collection of noble houses, merchants houses, and tribes that live in the Colander. The republic was formed due to the impossibility for a strong kingdom to form, not from any other high-minded ideal. Colander has been a much traveled across land, both from the barbarians plainsmen and orcish herders that have long made this land their home, to the many farmers and ranchers attempting to eke a living out of the mediocre soil. The land is under constant threat of attack, but since no one group was strong enough to consolidate the land under a single banner, they formed a coalition of mutual defense, for the different city states, kingdoms, and tribes that choose to participate in the republic. These are typically human, with a smattering of representation from elven, dwarven, and orcish senators. Senators themselves can be little more than delegates, or they can be the rulers of the cities or tribes they represent. Drasis is technically a member of this republic, but they are large and independent enough that they do not always bend to the decrees or consult thier fellow senators prior to making decisions.

A major trading city at the edge of the Tarajahn desert, this is where the people of the desert meet with the traders of the crescent. Many times,
caravans will disembark or switch guildsmen here, to prevent trade wars or to keep from going outside of their territory.

Founded as a small trade post in the heart of the Burning Plains, this city has swelled to be a major trade hub for the human horselords of the Abru tribes. This city has multiple districts that have grown into each other, each defended by their own combination of stone, wooden, or spiked walls, and since the horselords are as prone to make war on each other as they are to set up a common defense, the inhabitants of the city must be prepared to flee to the inner districts if a district is sacked or overrun by a marauding orc, gnoll or horseman tribe. As a result, even for the size of the city the architecture is generally unrefined and feels temporary, and the streets are made of dirt in all but the innermost districts.
