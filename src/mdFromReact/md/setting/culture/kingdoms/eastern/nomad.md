# Nomad Tribes of the Eastern Crescent

## Black Orcs of the Crescent

Hunters and herders, marauders and conquers, the Grul orcs of the crescent are a potent force to be reckoned with by the civilized lands that
they travel through. Named so because they are seasonal nomads that roam from the Entrarian Frontier in the north during the blazing southern
summers and to the El Dorado Kingdoms in the south to escape the harsh northern winters, the orcs migrate along a crescent trail. This trail is
loosely defined as the Vargr or Vargren Warpath. By staying constantly on the move, they continuously move into land with replenished wildlife
and new growth, and also take advantage of seasonal harvests by human settlers throughout the kingdoms. They also can avoid specific reprisal
from the stronger kingdoms within the crescent, though it is not uncommon for another orcish clan with a slightly different seasonal pattern to
absorb the brunt of militia or armies vengeance.

The orcs themselves gather in clans, a series of interrelated families lead by a strong leader. Crescent orcish nomads culture is largely driven by
the shifting loyalties within these clans, a careful balancing of multiple allegiances between factions within the tribe and the tribe itself. Common
tribal factions include splits between the beastmasters who ride on vargr, (huge wolves from the northern kingdoms that are capable of carrying
an orc) and scouts and runners that traditionally run on foot, factions along bloodlines, or between remnants of previous tribes that were absorbed
or conquered and the current ruling tribe. The religion of the orcs is generally a hodgepodge of worship and superstitions of both Malor and Grkaz
r, with Skarik making an occasional appearance due to influence of orcs from the Forged Lands.Because many clans share a similar cultural
foundation along the crescent, it is not uncommon for the orcs to roll up into larger groups or clans, either due to intermarriage within the clan, or
as a temporary alliance to face a greater threat. These alliances last however long the clan leaders can hold them - which typically is right up until
resources get squeezed.

### Wolfriders and Bloodrunners

Orcs of the Eastern Crescent primarily travel by foot. Orcs learn to run shortly after they learn to walk, and learn to carry their belongings shortly
after. Because of this, they develop great stamina - orcs are able to run in great bursts of speed for hunting, or in loping gaits for hours. While
some orcs occasionally will steal horses, or oxen, these things have little use in their society - they will run them ragged, then kill and eat them. In
fact, it is common practice that orcs will not fall asleep before killing stolen mounts, as they fear the creatures breaking free and leading enemies
back to them, or being stolen in the night. Better to ride them as far as they can go then feast on the animal before it can be taken. The orcish
nomads are very public about their disdain for the domesticated creatures the human use, servile beasts that will obey any master. Truthfully,
however, orcish attempts to domesticate animals fare poorly because of constant inner clan warfare, and the fact that typical animals are terrified
of orcs on an instinctual level.

However, some beasts survive alongside orchish tribes quite well. The brutish fae normally called "dire" beasts by the humans. Large wild dire
boars the size of small cattle, commonly known as Tusken, are known to be driven in great packs along nomad travel routes. Far from
domesticated, the fearsome beasts root up and eat everything they can, but grow quickly and provide a good source of meat for the clans.
Through a combination of chasing weaker boars and inciting large ones to stampede, tribes have mastered the art of moving their pigs along with
them. The hardy creatures need little in care, and protect themselves well. Orcs use these for food, as well as thick hide. Orcs have also been
known to drive wild shard oxen or other pack creatures along in a similar fashion where they can, though often with less success, and they are
keen to trade them out to humans for good steel or iron.

Orcish beastmasters are even more attenuated with the dire beasts, and will forge strong bonds that border on blood kinship with them. These
orcs are often alpha hunters and predators amongst the orcish tribe. The beastmasters of the Crescent clans most commonly bond with the
vicious vargr, which they use them to ride, hunt, scout, and fight. When bonded, they tend to pick up pack habits, and consider themselves
wolves, traveling with, resting, and sleeping along with their dire pack. They are called Wolfriders by the humans and wargriders by the elves and
dwarves, They call themselves vargren, and hunt at dusk and dawn, using heavy orcish bows they craft from oaken branches. These orcs have
tight-knit fraternity that can go beyond blood lines, and they will often meet with the wolves of another clan to trade information and stories, far
from the eyes of their respective clans, occasionally even while actively at war with that tribe. 

Becoming a vargren is technically open to all orcs, but in reality it is closer to hereditary, for the ways of a beastmaster generally must be taught,
and often requires considerable assistance from a skilled veteran. An orc becomes a vargren by traveling to a wild vargr pack, often the same
pack the orcish clan has visited for generations, and become acclimated to it. The vargr will accept or refuse the orc into their ranks, sorting
accepted newcomers into their hierarchy and driving away rejected orcs, typically by viciously mauling or even killing them. The mentors of
potential beastmasters will spend several weeks attempting to strengthen the bond of a candidate with the vargr home pack before they finally
send him to his greatest test - selecting a cub, which will eventually become the orcs mount and companion. It is rare for an older dire wolf to
bond with an orc. Vargren typically feel great kinship for thier beast, and while some will outlive thier vargr and select another on it's death, the
death of a vargr companion will frequently break a vargren, dooming it to wander away from the pack seeking death.

Occasionally an orcish beastmaster will bond with a non-vargr, though it is rare. Unmentored orcs with the gift sometimes bond with Tusken, and
become invaluable herdsmen for the tribe, having greater control and understanding of their herds. Solitary orcs will sometimes bond with
non-pack animals, such as dire bears (the orcs call them grzarboggen - they typically abandon the tribe.) Some fierce orcs have even been known
to bond with the mighty dragyr (dragoth dragonkin). These beastmasters rise to great prominence and positions of leadership, and generally
become great warlords or clan leaders.

The majority of orcs show no skill in beastmastery, or are rejected by the vargr, and will typically will become bloodrunners. Bloodrunners travel
by foot - running to travel, hunt, and fight. From a very young age, orcs learn to move quickly, silently, tirelessly. They must become swift enough
to travel before they are too old and big to carry, because an orc who cannot either run or ride fast enough to travel with the clan cannot continue
with them. Orcs who cannot run with the clan, due to injury, infirmary, or other circumstance are typically killed, as from a practical standpoint an
orc left behind could join a rival clan and betray clan secrets, or form their own clan. Occasionally, however, the orcs will simply abandon those, if
they feel as they have earned the honor to die alone.
