# Drasis

The kingdom of Drasis lays in the far southeastern corner of the South Eastern crescent, an expansive kingdom that stretches for hundreds of miles along the sir mountains. The kingdom considers its territory to include the mountains that run along the plains and forests claimed by the kingdom. The mountain stretches from the frozen cliffs of the northern territories, branching around a dry, windblasted basin known as the Vuai Desert. Valuable mines line the northern ridges of the desert lands. The land outside of the basin is on the hotter side of temperate, with muggy days and nights, and is so conducive to the jungle dwelling Dynastan Empire that they have maintained the slightest fingerhold upon the southern tip of the kingdom.

The north contains numerous thick forests, and the rulers of Drasis have done a good job of controlling the deforestation of the area where they believe it in their best interest, while the southern regions have resisted excessive civilization due to the dangerous nature of the competing cultures and peoples in that area.

Drasis both the kingdom and capital city of this land. The capital city is known as “The City of Lights”. Initially this was due to the cities affiliation with knowledge and wisdom during the Age of Reason. However, over time, the term has taken a more literal turn, as the city has become famous for its ornate streetlamps, and the many lights within the cities shops, homes and public centers.

Technically a member of the Colander Republic, the Kingdom of Drasis is a strong military presence in the Eastern Crescent, as well as a center for culture, fashion, and art. It ships valuable and exotic spices east along the Silk Road, to be traded both in Tarajah, the northern kingdoms, and the coastal empires. The trade in salt, spice, dyes and the like have made them incredibly wealthy, and finance their military and cultural pursuits. This is what allowed the city to stonewall the second Dynastan legion during the Fifth Age, and what allows them to take a hard stand against the various orcish, beastman, and titan tribes that wander the eastern plains. They keep strong forts along both major warfronts, which allow calvary to be
dispatched with lightning speed into the frontier, and the dangerous independent orders of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Watchtowers provide an additional shield against their enemies. This allows the various townships and cities within the bounds of these protective cities a certain amount of protection. There are still the occasional raid - but they are not frequent, as the orcs have easier targets both north and south of Drasis and the mountain tribes have a long journey from the mountains to strike one of the inner cities - making it unlikely a warband can escape a retaliatory strike from Drasis calvary, even if they make it there undetected.

For this reason, the merchant houses of the kingdom of Drasis feel
secure in aggressively competing amongst themselves for money
and political clout. While technically a kingdom, tradition has long
held the position of king as to be the commander of armies and chief
strategist on the field, and the upholder of laws in the towns. In other
words, the king sees to the security of the land - the people are
responsible to see to their own prosperity. And since the taxes levied
upon the merchant houses are always sufficient to fund the armies
and guardsmen of the kingdom, the king sees little reason to object to
how private land is purchased or sold, how business is conducted
between his citizen wards and the world at large.
It is an ideal environment for capitalists and wealthy aristocratic
families, much less ideal for the poorer citizens and the travelers with
no claim to a nation that come through the land. The wealthy tend to
live in extreme luxury - plumbing is common in well to do sections of
the city, along with theatre, dining, gambling, and art houses that are
envied across Icara. The gladiatorial arena in the capitol city, just as
Tarajah, pits free warriors against exotic beasts and deadly
challenges - and those who have a taste for more illicit combat need
only to travel south to Aretium, where the Dynastans still allow
enslaved fighters to fight for their lives or freedom, in accordance with
Dynastan law.
The common exports of salt, spice, steel and silk travel along the
major trade routes northwest to major trading ports in Tarajah,
Uruthia, and Andarii. 

While slavery is technically illegal in Drasis, private grounds are not
thoroughly searched without cause, and several unscrupulous
houses are rumored to do brisk business with the Dynastan merchant
cities to the south. Similarly, the smuggling operations between the
various kingdoms run the gamut of black market operations, from
trade of rare and exotic items, to teaching and propagating forbidden
magics or religions, to simple run of the mill tariff dodging schemes.

### Reknowned Merchant Houses of Drasis

House Musilia: Owners of many of the salt mines
through Salidale, and have branched to fine work in
steel and iron and the export of masonry as their
primary mines have been plumbed out. A well
respected family, with a keenly developed sense of
enterprise and innovation. Still run by the descendants
of the initial founding family, and members can be
found throughout the cities of Drasis.
House Bellona: Farmers, weavers and herbalists,
House Bellona owns many mulberry orchards, silk and
cotton farms throughout Drasis, especially near
Haleshire and Leceron. The artisans of House Bellona
then spin both into clothing and linen, ranging from the
fabulous, artistic and decadently expensive to
practical, comfortable and affordable. While there are
many Drasis weavers, the dyes, techniques, and
quality of House Bellona is considered unmatched by
many.
House Tefari: Aggressively profit driven, House Tefari
has their hands in many businesses, from salt and
spice mining to allocating mercenaries to be used
throughout the Colander Republic. They are always on
the lookout for an unexploited market that they can
use for their own good, and have on more than one
occasion bought out a business rival, or exploited
market shares that have opened as a result of a rival's
tragedy. Several prominent members in this house
have been caught running slaves to Dynastan flesh
merchants - House Tefari has dutifully offered them up
to the king's justice, and publicly admonishes those
who would follow in their footsteps.
House Agreigor: Agreigor owns a number of art and
culture houses throughout Drasis, in addition to
gambling dens and brothels in a number of other
merchant cities. Agreigor is heavily in the market of
exporting Drasis itself - often carrying the goods of
rival houses to farflung corners of Icara. They employ
and recruit mercenaries, travelers, peddlers and
actors, to create an authentic experience in
non-authentic Drasis locations.
