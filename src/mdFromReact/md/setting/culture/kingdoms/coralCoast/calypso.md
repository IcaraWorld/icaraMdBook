# Calypso

## Geography

The kingdom of Calypso sits along the Alerian coast, a vast range of ports that service the Shimmering and Sunset Isles. The lands themselves tend to be rocky, acidic, and not very fertile near the Dragonspine mountains that form a natural barrier between the coastline and the Tarajahan desert on its eastern borders. This means despite the large rainfall, the Alerian coast remains relatively sparse, with the exception of some of the coastal meadows near certain parts of the coast with most of its agricultural needs being provided by the islands near them and the large grain producing kingdoms to  the south.

## Civilization

An empire formed of traders, pirates and fishermen, shipping trade goods overland to the Uruth empire and Avelos or to southern ports along the Coral Coast, this wide ranging and powerful conglomerate of guilds, navies, and warlords is multicultural with many competing interests. Calypso was held loosely in check for generations under a clan of pirate kings, but their deposal at the hands of a sorcerer priest of Loki has led to constant power struggles in the kingdom.
