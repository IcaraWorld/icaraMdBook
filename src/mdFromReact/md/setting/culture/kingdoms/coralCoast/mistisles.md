# Mist Isles

## Geography

Where the Nijierasill rushes into the ocean, there exists a large archipelago, containing hundreds of islands in a large freshwater sea fed by the torrential river. The northernmost amongst these are known as the Mist Isles, due to the fog that hangs over them at all times, where the much warmer freshwater meets the Sea of Shards, creating an estuaries that is used as a breeding ground for numerous fish and sea creatures. The mountainous isles are hounded by the cold winds of the north, and can be treacherous to navigate through for those who donâ€™t know where the currents lead, and which  shorelines are rocky death traps and which are safe coves.

## Civilization

The northern isles are the home to stoic human fishermen and sailors, as well as small frost dwarven communities. For the most part, these communities are divided by clans, which form alliances to gather enough warriors when needed for warfare. Despite the lack of a strong organization, these hearty people have managed to retain independence from the strong kingdoms around them.
