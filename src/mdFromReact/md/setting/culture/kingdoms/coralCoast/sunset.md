# Sunset Isles

## Geography

The sunset isles mark the last vestiges of the unnatural freshwater torrent funneling from the mainland. Many lowset, swampy islands exist in the series of tropical mangroves. The unnatural warmth of the Shimmering Isles begins to fade to the vast chill of the ocean here.

## Civilization

The Sunset Isles have fewer groups then the Shimmering Isles, but still quite a few tribes, clans, and settlers that live throughout them, mostly subsets of the same species that have been pushed out of the freshwater seas. There is also a unique subset of tekulti that live in the swampy sections of the Sunset Isles, cultural variants of their southern cousins.
