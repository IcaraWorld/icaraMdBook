# Shimmering Isles

## Geography

The shimmering isles exist in the middle of the Nijierasill archipelago, a large gathering of islands in a freshwater sea. Because of the abundance of fresh, usable water, great kelp forests grow throughout the islands, and all of the islands are incredibly lush, with massive forests growing on the islands. The weather and temperature is unnaturally tropical…much closer to temperatures and flora and fauna you would find near the equator, in fact, it is warmer in this small subsection of ocean than it is to the south and west. This differentiation is part of what keeps the Mist Isles habitable compared to the Mjorn Tundra and Overlook….the heat moderates the chill somewhat on these nearby islands. There is some amount of argument whether the warmth is due to underground volcanic activity superheating parts of the ocean alleviating the general chill of the rest of the sea, or whether it is magical in nature. The current of the warm water is pushed south, along the coastline and away from the Sea of Shards. The mainland to the east of the Shimmering Isles and Sunset Isles is known as the Aleria Coast.

## Civilization

The Shimmering Isles is home to a fair number of island peoples, both human, elven, orcish, dwarven and rakasha. There are a number of grey elf civilizations here, as well as non-traditional cultures of sea dwelling creatures such as mermen. Because of the large amount of produced food here, several neighboring kingdoms have farming colonies, and piracy is not uncommon, both from the north, south, and locally.
