# Stormhead Frontier

## Geography

The Stormhead Frontier is the farthest northwest corner of the mainland underneath the mouth of the Nijierasill, at the tip of the Aleria coast. To the west are the Shimmering Isles, to the east is the kingdoms of Avelos, and to the south is the kingdom of Calypso. The lands of the Stormhead frontier are temperate lands with heavy rainfall and rich soils. Thick green forests and lush coastal meadows are the result.


## Civilization

The kingdoms of Avelos and Calypso have longstanding disputes regarding the ownership of the Stormhead Frontier, with neither able to establish a firm hold upon the rugged lands but neither willing to cede its claim. Unaligned tribes of wood elves also live within these lands, and the combined high elf and wood elf populations are popular targets for raiding parties from the Mjorn Tundra and Overlook who are seeking not wealth but fame and reputation for bleeding ancient racial foes, but perfectly willing to sack the settlements of any human frontier settlements they come across. As a result, there are few undefended settlements and not much agriculture, despite the rich land.
