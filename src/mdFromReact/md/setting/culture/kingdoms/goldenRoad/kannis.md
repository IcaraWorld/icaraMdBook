# Kannis

Kannis lies south of the Tarajahan desert, in a huge mountain valley nestled in the southern Dragonspine mountains. There is a good amount of rainfall in these mountains due to the elevation, and the valley intersperses heavily wooded pastures with rocky hills.

The civilized portion of Kannis is populated by monotheistic kingdom of humans. They are in heavy conflict with the goblin, orc, and ogre tribes that live in the mountains and hills surrounding the kingdom. Kannis has a well developed military due to constant conflict with both them, and the neighboring kingdom of Shaldar.
