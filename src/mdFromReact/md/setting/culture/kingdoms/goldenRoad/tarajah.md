# Tarajah

## Geography

The kingdom of Tarajah is self contained within the walls of one massive city. The city is located within the middle of the Tarajahan desert, which
bears its name. Tarajah is built upon the remains of its previous ruins, the much larger city of the same name built by the sorcerer king Magus.
Most of the city remains uncivilized and in ruins, a dangerous maze miles wide of destroyed buildings, underground tunnels, and abandoned
keeps that contain all manner of monsters and hideouts for criminals, . Tarajah is a land of a great amount of magic – many ley lines converge
and run through the city, making the city a favored destination for seekers of power. For reasons unknown to modern scholars, Tarajah’s night
and day run at different times than the rest of the region – it is always night when it is day out in the desert, and day during the night. Everyone
agrees that sorcery is involved, but what manner of magic could do such a thing and when it was done is unknown.

## Civilization

Tarajah is the most densely populated city in Icara, a city of widely divergent cultures – the city has stayed true to its founding principles, that all
creatures are welcome. Large populations of many monstrous races, including titans, giants, dragons, orcs, goblins, and gnolls legally live and
work here within the city proper, or illegally dwell in the back alleys as tribes. There are also fey, demonic, and astral creatures from other realms,
sustained here by the immense magical output. Temples to every major religion can be found within Tarajah’s massive city walls, and adventurers
and merchants pour in from all corners of Icara to see the sights, ply their trades or see combat in the great Coliseum.
With so many ancient enemies in one place, violent confrontation is inevitable, and war within the walls often seems unavoidable. However,
Tarajah’s streets are patrolled by some of the most seasoned warriors and mages in Icara, and their rulers are almost always powerful individuals
more at home on the battlefield than a negotiating table. Cities with diplomatic relations or merchant ties with the city have learned long ago that
compliance is the best tactic to employ with Tarajahan envoys, whether they are the legal representatives of the city or the powerful guilds
contained within.
