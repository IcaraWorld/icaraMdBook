# Perchin

The kingdom of Perchin, also called the “Mouth of the Dragonspine”, is a kingdom that revolves around a thriving trade city under the control of hill
and mountain dwarf clans. Built at the head of the mountain pass leading into the Golden Road, it oversees the shipment of valuable trade goods
from numerous southern kingdoms along the land route north.

Half of the territory of the Perchin kingdom is the jagged mountains of the Dragonspine, and the other half are the flowing plains of the southern
kingdoms. Both sets of terrain can be barren, but in different ways, one a set of windblasted peaks that contain sparse vegetation and animal life,
and the other an endless rolling ocean of brush, grass vegetation and the occasional beast.

Perchin attracts visitors from the around Icara for a number of reasons. Its centralized location along the northern borders of what are known as the Southern kingdoms make it valuable as a trade city, and its reputation as a highly defensible bulwark of stability make it attractive for those seeking security in what is often a violent land. It is also famous for being that city the dreaded Dynastan march was stopped at, and housing the site of an ascension to godhood, (the destroyed battlements upon which Sylith ascended.) For these reasons it attracts merchants, townspeople and tourists in large numbers, including a steady stream of Dynastan pilgrims.

While initially founded by humans, during the fifth age the dwarven kingdom of Kardonach slowly gathered control of the kingdom, first by stationing a large force of soldiers there during the successive Dynastan campaigns following Sylith’s ascension, and then by gradually taking control of the city financially and economically. By the time a dwarven chancellor was “elected”, few could even remember a time when humans held real influence in the city.
The dwarven rulers care most about the city of Perchin proper, and controlling the mountainous terrain that leads back to their home kingdom. However, they understand the fiscal value of policing the southern plains as well, and do what they can to clear it of bandits and military threats to allow the unfettered travel of the merchants that make them rich.
