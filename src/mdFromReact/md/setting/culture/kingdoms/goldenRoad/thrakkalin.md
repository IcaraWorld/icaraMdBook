# Thrak’kalin

Thrak’kalin stretches deep into the Tarajahan desert, contains the Dragontail mountains, and the forests leading into the Eastern crescent (known
as Eden’s gate). Fabled to be the last remnants of Tarajah’s previous great garden, Eden’s gate is an incredibly lush and magical forest tended by
the high priests of Magus.

Thrak’kalin has a vast array of different civilizations, due both to its proximity to Tarajah as well as the wide variety of geographic terrain within the area. The desert dunes hold a number of desert nomads, who travel from oasis to oasis, making their living either guiding the merchants and travelers to the civilized cities through the dangers of the desert, or by robbing them. In addition, there are villages of medusae, known as the
Madear, hostile to all outsiders, scattered throughout the desert. The Dragontail mountains are the home to a variety of tribes of orcs, ogres, and goblin tribes, and Eden’s gate has a number of fae creatures and wood elf tribes. 

This is to not even begin talking of the human trade cities that have been formed along this route, including Traubadeen, built into a pass through
Dragontail mountains, a major trade city along the Silk road.
