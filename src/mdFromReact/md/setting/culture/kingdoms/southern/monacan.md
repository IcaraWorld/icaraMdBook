# Monacan Badlands

Alternately called the Monacan frontier, this wide, rugged land to the southeast of the Drasis kingdom is a dry, barren series of mountains and caves, desert and brushland that is considered barely habitable. Rain is rare in these lands, and what rain does fall quickly runs through the terrain to underground caves and streams. For this reason there is little farming in the area. 

Orc and goblin tribes abound, and it is also a popular location for large bandits or outlaw gangs that prey on the Drasis trade routes. For this reason, Drasis has established a variety of forts in the region, despite it being outside their kingdom, no other kingdom sees fit to patrol it, and it is too hard to establish settlements under normal circumstances. Drasis will often send criminals here to serve out their sentences doing hard labor, either clearing land for farming for the intrepid (or foolhardy) settlers still attempting to tame the land, or fighting the dangerous elements in the area. Prisoners may come from anywhere along the Silk Road trade route, and this means that prisoners from all over the Northern Kingdoms may end up in this hostile terrain. Escaped criminals may end up joining the bandits that roam the land, or may be enslaved by priests of Bane from Crubazar to the west.
