# Forged Lands

In ancient times, dating back to the Second Age, great wizards attempted to bend open the planes of existence, and connect this one place as a
gate to all other worlds. The result of this was the forged lands, a great mystical wound opened within the sir mountain range, still bleeding
disturbances from the rifts created. Fortunately, this place is tucked well away from the civilized realms, and the stories surrounding it are most
often confused with myths and legends.

The Forged Lands are surrounded on all sides by mountains, and are around the same latitude as the Entarian Frontier. Its connection with
normal geography ends there however, as various elemental, astral, and infernal landscapes manifest themselves within this area. If there was
any place on Icara one could reasonable expect to slip to another plane of existences without knowing a single cantrip, it is this place. The
creatures that inhabit this realm are frequently magical or extraplanar in nature….it doesn’t take long for a wandering natives of Icara to become
food within this realm, whether they are sheep or people.

There is little in the way of civilization here. The forged lands have barbarian people who roam and live on the land…powerful warriors from
cultish communities who have managed to carry on if not thrive in the realm. There is however a single city, shining as a beacon in the madness –
Shadowdale, a city rumored to be built on holy Astral ground, which is now used as a foothold into both the civilized realm and the plane scarred
terrain.
