## Titles

Goddess of Mercy, Mother of Mercy, Goddess of Healing, Queen of Peace

## Ethos

The beloved human goddess of healing is a goddess of mercy and kindness. The worshippers of the goddess do what they can to relieve the suffering of the poor, afflicted, and downtrodden. Cruelty, war, and harsh punishments are frowned upon by the clergy, and they are generally a very forgiving and considerate group. The goddess herself has very few commandments for her worshippers, save that they ease suffering where they see it. Venus has gained a large following among those tired of warfare or strive, and is rarely a religion of an entire city as their policy of forgiveness and mercy doesn't lend itself well to keeping order amongst the citizen, or protecting their walls. Venus is typically considered a good influence, though, and many religions allow the worship, or at least acknowledgement, of the goddess in addition to whatever local religions are present.

## Worship

Worshippers of Venus are predominately female, and almost always doctors or herbalists. Nearly every temple to the goddess serves as a makeshift orphanage, hospital, and shelter. The priestesses of healing will rarely, if ever, raise a sword in their own defense, instead relying on the many religions and cities that will do so for them in exchange for the humanitarian efforts in Venus' name. Along these lines, Venus grants many curative and protective spells, but never those of war or death. She makes herself known as a presence, not of protection or power, but a warm sense of acceptance and peace.

Venus is often worshipped in alongside the elven goddess Maayiel, or alongide Tyr and Toren as part of the Trinity.

## History

#TODO (Maayiel mentioned, change after rename)

Venus is a figure of the Third Age, the Age of Reason. She was a peacemaker and a healer that traveled up and down the face of Icara, attempting to bring attention to the plight of the poor and to heal the afflicted. She is often represented as a stunning blonde in artwork and sculpture, and was renowned for her humility, patience, kindness, and power. It was said that there was no disease she couldn't banish, no would she couldn't heal, and she was sought diligently by the richest and most powerful kings. She denied no one her assistance, be they rich or poor, but she was never tied to any one place or people, traveling to wherever she perceived the greatest need. She is often worshipped in conjunction with Maayiel, an elvish goddess that traveled with her and was also a great peacemaker in her time. The two women apparently vanished in the same time period, and the legends of their deeds soon blossomed into outright worship. There are many legends concerning their disappearance, ranging from immediate ascension for the life of good deeds, to resurrection and ascension after they were killed by orcs, barbarians, or some other foul creature or culture (depending on where the legend is being told). Some scholars deny that Venus ascended at all, since she doesn't manifest herself in any physical way, and they claim that those that worship are simply honoring her memory and siphoning healing magic from another benevolent deity.
