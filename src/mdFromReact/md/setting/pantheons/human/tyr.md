# Tyr - God Of Justice

## Titles

God of Justice, God of War, God of Law, Lawbringer

## Ethos

The god Tyr rewards those of strength, courage, and steadfastness. He smiles upon honor and truthfulness in word and deed, and being honest and fair. As such, he is called upon by humans from the warriors in the field to the judges and kings of the realm. He expects fidelity and loyalty from his worshippers, not just in their dealings with him, but also in their dealings with each other. As such, theft, murder, dishonorable war, killing of the weak or helpless, disrespect of elders or superiors, and disobedience are all frowned upon by his priests. Obviously, the opposite is held in high regard, and he especially smiles on excellence and courage. He is generally regarded as a good god, and few societies ban his worship. Those that do generally do so because of pacifist leanings, or worship of an opposing god.

## Worship
#TODO (ADD EXPENSIVENESS SOMEWHERE????)

Typically, worship of Tyr is a very noticeable and public endeavor. He encourages his followers to build places of worship and to undertake good deeds in his name. His religions tend to have a very organized structure, with priests, bishops, and leaders elected or chosen based on their prominence. His worship does not forbid or preclude worship of other gods as long as they are not aligned against Tyr.

Tyr himself liberally rewards his worshippers with spells and protections. His presence is very active in his places or worship, and he has been known to appear as either a presence or an avatar. As a presence he tends to be inspirational and empowering to his followers, and as an avatar he tends to appear as a giant golden warrior, wreathed in flames.

Tyr is often worshipped alongside Venus and Toren as part of the Trinity.

### Symbology and Iconography

Most prominent is a plate armored fist holding the scales of justice, though there are several variations wielding swords.

## History

Tyr is always depicted as human, and is considered to be a human god, though he does allow worship by those of other races. He is the first known god of the human people, and as such is often referred to as their patron god. Tyr was first known to man as a god that was worshipped for strength in war, during the Age of Blood. In that time many crusades were fought, and many great victories were won, but many massacres and atrocities were also committed in his name. The tenants of justice that he now espouses seem to have been added at a later date, leading some scholars to speculate that the Tyr known to man now actually replaced the original god of War. If so, he retained the name and worshippers of the prior god. This, of course, is considered blasphemy by the current priests of Tyr, and those scholars can be tried and executed in the more extreme cities of worship dedicated to the god.
