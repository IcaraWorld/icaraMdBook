## Titles

God of Protection, God of Virtue, God of Redemption, God of the Shield, The Preacher, The Judge

## Ethos

Another god commonly called upon by warriors, Toren espouses many virtues, especially prizing loyalty, as well as defending the weak and helpless. The weak should be protected. The hungry, fed. The homeless, sheltered. Above all, Toren preaches redemption of sinners. Minor sins include: lack of compassion for the less fortunate, lack of humility, laziness, gluttony, capriciousness, petulance, greed, and envy. Serious sins include: theft, fornication, violence against the weak or unfortunate, and oppression of the unfortunate (through starvation or deprivation). Of all sins, betrayal and disloyalty are considered to be the most dire, and the only sins which a priest of Toren would find nigh unforgivable. Toren's priests teach penance and repentance for sins, and are usually quite vociferous in their attempts to bring the population to the light. Words and deeds are considered of equal import in the attempts to bring the godless to redemption.

## Worship

Worshippers of Toren are generally warriors or warrior priests. Because so much of the faith is based on protecting the downtrodden, priests and monk of Toren keep themselves fit and able. Sloth and laziness is frowned up on in the order. Also, thought the church itself can acquire wealth, the individual gathering on wealth is considered sinful and priests keep only what is necessary for their needs, which may vary depending on how they serve the church. Worship of other gods is frowned upon, for the simple reason that priests of Toren consider other gods misguided, and believe that true peace and redemption will only be found through Toren. Toren himself never appears as an avatar, but is often found as a presence. Priests fighting in his name can sometimes find themselves invulnerable to pain or damage.

Additionally, the priests of Toren often serve the downtrodden in their communities, providing food and shelter to the less fortunate and guiding the hands of their more affluent followers to provide as well.

Toren is often worshipped alongside Venus and Tyr, much to his chagrin, as part of the Trinity.

## History

Toren is an Ascended god, his ascension a matter of historical record as it occurred during the Fourth Age. A devout and merciful king in a large kingdom south of Tarajah, Toren and his knights defended many helpless refugees and displaced individuals from all walks of life. As his city swelled in number, it began to gain notoriety around the world as a sanctuary from the power-mad Mage Kings. When, eventually, Bane turned his hand and armies against the scattered people who had escaped him, the might king and his powerful Shield Knights fended off the depraved Lord of Apocalypse. The city held until the betrayal of Archen, one of the king's inner circle of knights, left the besieged city vulnerable. Legend disagrees as to what happened next. The priests of Toren claim the entire kingdom was then lifted, and all of its citizens ascended to heaven and peace. Some scholars believe that only the king and his knights and soldiers ascended, leaving tens of thousands of citizens to be slaughtered by the merciless knights of Bane. This was the direct claim of Bane directly after the ascension, recorded by historians of the era. The powerful mage claimed to the world that the king had fled like a coward, leaving his people to be slaughtered as they begged for their good king's aid. Scholars disagree on whether the combined desperate pleas of his people let to the ascension, or whether Toren truly was mighty enough to pull an entire city to salvation. The truth is unknown, but what is known is that the priests of Toren will try to execute a follower of Bane simply for the heresy of their religion, and that followers of Bane hold a special emnity for The Preacher, as well.
