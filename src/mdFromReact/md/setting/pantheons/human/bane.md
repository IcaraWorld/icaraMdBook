# Bane - God of Doom

## Titles

God of Doom, God of Destruction, Lord of Apocalypse, The One King, The Black Emperor

## Ethos

The tyrannical God of Destruction rules over a religion of coercion and conquest. Bane is depicted as a knight or king, with either spike laden armor made of black iron or a skull-adorned set of regal attire, depending on the cult. He has been depicted as a human, a demon, a skeletal knight, and many more terrifying creatures in religious art.

The priests of Ban and the god himself seek no less than the total domination of the world. The worshippers of Bane believe that mortals are foolish, confused creatures incapable of making the most basic decisions concerning truth. They believe that mortals are incapable of distinguishing between "good" and "evil", and can live in peace only under overwhelming force of a common master. For this reason, there may not be equals to the One King, Bane. The faithful of Bane teach that truth is what their dark master commands it to be, for there can be no universal truth, only the truth of Bane's law.

## Worship

Bane's followers live in a very hierarchal fashion. Rebellion is not tolerated, free thinking is not tolerated, because what is "lawful" or "unlawful", "good" or "evil" is determined by your leader. The only basic right granted to the followers of Bane and their subjects is the right to life if total obedience is given. Bane's faithful create society and civilization by suppressing the selfish and conflicting desire of the masses, uniting them in worship of Bane.

Devoted followers of Bane are very demanding and intolerant of their charges. Children and spouses are often considered little more than property, and individuals of lower rank or station are dealt with brutally. Control is established with an iron fist, and high priests of Bane are known to resort to all manner of methods to preserve their stranglehold on a a people or region. This includes causing troublesome individuals to simply disappear, as well as dividing families and moving them all to different parts of the world, or shipping a native people to a far off foreign location, separating them from allies and and the comforts of home to aid in controlling them. They richly reward those who would turn in free thinkers and revolutionaries, seeking to create an atmosphere where subjects only feel safe trusting Bane's dark servants. Important political persons are held in check through blackmail or threats to loved ones. Bane's priests have never shirked from torture, considering pain and suffering a valuable scourge of evil thoughts. Their dark magic is said to have even more severe methods, from mind control to voiding a person's mind and soul altogether, leaving them a compliant husk more than a person.

What cannot be controlled is put to the torch. Bane's disciples are quick to war, quick to punishment and execution, quick to genocide. Societies or peoples that are considered undesirable are destroyed without question, others are given the simple choice of renouncing all other religion and following Bane or being put to death. In societies were Bane is relegated to a cult status, cultists will slaughter families so they can steal babies and children to begin the indoctrination of the youth in the ways of Bane, preserving their religion when they cannot convert otherwise.

The religion presents an uncomfortable thorn in the side of many civilizations, as the followers of Bane can appear lawful, and even to present a stabilizing force in a region. The warriors of Bane have quelled uprisings, wars, and military threats, their beneficence belying their sinister nature. Their darker acts are often kept under wraps, performed in secret, as Bane waits patiently for his priests to build up power and influence in a region. Kings and those in power are swayed by the message of Bane, that he with the most power is the one true law, believing the doctrine to suggest that they will be the ones to continue to rule their land. A wise kingdom recognize, however, that the servants of Bane serve only one master, and that each kingdom that has fallen under the sway of the Dark Emperor has become another joyless, grim pit of endless toil and constant fear.

## History

Bane is a figure of the Fourth Age. Some might argue that he was the catalyst for the Fourth Age, as the powerful mage king set about the world with an army to convert or destroy all he could get his brutal hands on. His armies expanded ever onward, indoctrinating humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, ogres, giants, and dragons. They subverted those that could be subverted, enslaving those that could be enslaved, and killing those who could not be managed any other way. Often, though, the mage king would raise those among the slaughtered to join his army as undead warriors. Kingdom after kingdom was razed, and with each that fell Bane's armies and power grew. A terrifying figure, the man who became known as the Apocalypse personified towered above his warriors wielding a massive blade imbued with earth-rending power. His own magic was the match of all but the most powerful of the mage kings, and it seemed for a long while that we could subsume Icara completely.

Bane never had that chance. En route through a series of kingdoms of little consequence, he was destroyed in the depth of night in a massive spell blast, consuming him and his closest warriors. No one knows what stopped his hellish march of conquest, but there are many theories. One is that he was visited by Tyr, and destroyed by the wrath of the angry god. In a similar vein, it is supposed that Toren (who's ascension had been the result by Bane's attack on his city) may have visited his revenge upon him. Others say that the most powerful of the mage kings, Magus, struck him down before he could turn his vast armies on Tarajah. It is also theorized that Bane, always one to push the boundaries of his magical prowess, simply destroyed himself while concocting some hellish ritual. Other believe that Bane's death was his own plan, sacrificing himself and his best warriors to cement his status as a god. After his Ascension, his army was scattered, but many continued to serve their dark lord. It's noted that many demons joined in the worship of Bane after his Ascension, and many fear that the Lord of Apocalypse was simply extending his reach from the conquest of Icara, to that of all of reality.
