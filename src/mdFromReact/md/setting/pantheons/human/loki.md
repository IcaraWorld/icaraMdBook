# Loki - God of Mischief

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

God of Thievery, God of Mischief, God of Luck, God of Daring, The Trickster

## Ethos

It's a rare temple, but a common guild house that holds an idol of the Trickster. Hardened thieves and treasure hunters call to him for luck, and children sing his name in boisterous tones while skipping across the streets of large cities. The lawless God of Thieves tenants are not of an evil god, as he exhorts kindness to the young and helpless and mercy to those you can grant it, but neither are they those of a good god. Loki shines favor on the bold and daring, as well as the clever. Those who take risks are his favorite. While he frowns on exploiting the poor or the weak, he has no problem victimizing the wealthy, swindling a peer, or embarrassing the proud or foolish.

## Worship

Those who worship Loki exclusively are usually high-profile thieves and practical jokers that do their best to shake up the society of those they victimize. Loki is one of the easiest gods to casually worship, since he asks nothing of his worshippers and espouses a "if it feels good, do it" type of philosophy, generally. However, should he happen to favor a follower with a "divine quest" (usually demanding a masterful prank or theft of a priceless artifact), the price of piety can increase dramatically.

## History

Loki was a famous thief in the Third Age, the Age of Reason. No matter the stake, no matter the odds, the Trickster seemed capable of stealing the most well-guarded treasures. No mage king terrified him, no empire's treasury too sacred to be looted, he seemed to be on a quest to steal the best-guarded secrets and treasures from around the world. Legends of Loki's lair survive to this day, tales of a cavern of endless wealth to titillate and inspire treasure hunters. He conspired to steal countless items of power forged by the mage kings, leaving his trademark calling care of a gold key in a silver lock at each site. Try as they might, the wronged kingdoms could never track him down, no matter how much gold was proffered as a reward. Eventually, the master thief simply disappeared. It was assumed that his legendary luck had eventually run out... until his golden key began appearing on holy symbols and prison yard tattoos. Some say that he had snuck into heaven and stolen an item of immeasurable power from the gods themselves. Others, paying heed to a persistent rumor that Loki was the divine offspring of Bhaal, simply said that he had grown weary of playing mortals for fools and had returned to the plan from whence he came.
