# Tyra - Goddess of Nature

## Titles

Goddess of Nature. Gaia, Primal Mother


## Ethos

Tyra is the elvish Goddess of Nature. Her worshippers say that she controls the seasons, the sun, the
moon, and that she breathed life into all that walks the earth. She is often depicted as a fair skinned
elven woman with hair that grows to her ankles, adorned with flowers and plants, or as a carefree
elvish child, and is prayed to by many who depend on the whims of the natural world to survive.

Tyra’s faithful depict her as a gentle and loving mother, one who wishes no avoidable death on
anyone. Despite the harshness of the natural world, the nature spirit supposedly harbors no ill will
toward anyone. Tyra’s priests believe in achieving true happiness by following ones natural essence.

This includes plant and animal, prey and predator, rock or ocean breeze. The worship of Tyra means
a belief in the animus of almost every thing in the natural world. The goal of the priesthood is to
maintain that natural order by suppressing overly destructive creatures and forces, aiding the growth
and well being of the natural world.

## Worship

The priests of Tyra are often guardians of the forest, protectors of nature, enemies of disease, blight,
famine, and any other force that would destroy the natural world. While she is an elvish goddess,
many non-elves have taken her teachings to heart as well. You can find worshippers of Tyra among
the elves, humans, rakasha, dwarves, and even the dynastan and the orcs. She is also widely
worshipped by dryads, nymphs and treants, centaurs, wisps, and many other intelligent but
non-humanoid creatures. The elf faction that have come to be known as wood elves are her most
faithful worshippers, and are known as Tyra’s elves (or Tyras elves) as well as by their more
traditional name.

## History

There is debate as to whether Tyra should be called an Elder, Created, or Ascended God. She has
been present since the beginning of recorded history, but her ascendance is part of the elvish
creation myth. Tyra was the first of the elvish race, the first creature Jarallan breathed life into in all
the world. From here she took on many of the creation duties herself, and is supposedly the mother of
the elements and the race of elves. The Sacred Tree that once grew in the heart of the elvish lands
was the manifestation of her will, and the first thing she planted, which she used as food and shelter
for all the young things of the world.
Despite being, according to legend, older than the elements themselves, Tyra is often worshipped as
a child, and equally spoken of as one who can protect and one who needs protecting. She is beloved
goddess by the elvish people, and widely worshipped by non-urban peoples, but has few if any
strongholds of worship in major cities. She is generally acknowledged, and she is considered a good
goddess, though she is more accurately described as neutral.

## Variant Worship – Gaia

As seen in Elemental worship, as part of the Sacred Sisters interpretation of elemental gods. In this
interpretation, instead of being the creator of and above all of the elemental gods, she is simply a part
of the elemental gods. See Gaia.
