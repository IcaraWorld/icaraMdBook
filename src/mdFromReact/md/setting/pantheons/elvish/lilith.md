# Lilith - Goddess of Shadows

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

Goddess of Shadows. Queen of Murder, Shadow Queen, Queen of Blood, Devouring Night, Sylph of Death.

## Ethos

Lilith, the cunning and powerful goddess of the dark elves, is rare worshipped by those
without elven blood coursing through their veins. The reason for this is fairly simple, for
the Queen of Murder’s stated goal is no less than the death of every non-elven
humanoid on the planet. Her beloved people, the vicious and merciless dark elves,
travel in the lightless tunnels and caves under the surface of Icara known as the
Shadowdeep, threatening to spring up anywhere at any time to transform a civilization
into a holocaust.

The Shadow Queen herself preaches strength, cunning and utter lack of mercy while
dealing with foes. The lesson itself applies to all that would stand in the way of their
goal, and the teachings have made the dark elves their own worst enemies, as they
wage an endless war seeking supreme power and perfect techniques of war and
death. As they step over the fallen bodies of their kin to demonstrate their own
worthiness, they see only the smile of their dark queen, urging them on to destroy the
creatures of the world above.

## Worship

Followers of the Lilith seek to demonstrate this worthiness with prowess in battle and
cunning strategy. They prove this to themselves and their goddess by waging endless
war against whomever stands against them, or even those that just happen to be
nearby. The faithful of Lilith are among the most deadly soldiers, sorcerers and priests
that live. Unfortunately for them (and fortunately for the world) they find themselves
pitted against each other just as often as they are against outsiders. Backstabbing
power plays are common among the followers of Lilith.

On the surface, many elvish cultist who secretly believe that the elven race is doomed
unless the other races are brought to heel work to accomplish that end. This is
especially prevalent in high elf society, where elven elite and commoners alike may
work behind the scenes to throw kingdoms in disarray through assassination and
intrigue to weaken them and advance the agenda of Lilith.

## History

Lilith has been given many titles by the terror filled populations she has hunted. Before
she was called any of them, however, she was called savior.

As a soldier in the wars the elves waged during the Age of Blood, Lilith turned the tide of their wars from continual defeat at the hands of the well equipped, well disciplined dwarves in the elves favor. She quickly escalated through the command structure of the elven armies, culminating with her being put in charge of the entire elvish military. Lilith copied dwarven military hierarchy to instill discipline and unity of purpose into her 
soldiers, then moved beyond anything the world had seen in military coordination of magic and strategy. The unstoppable menaces that had threatened the elven people crumbled against an ever growing and fanatically loyal elvish war machine. The dwarves were sealed into their holes. Growing threats from humans and orcs were silenced with singled minded precision. The elvish people were safe. Lilith, however, was far from satisfied. As long as these mongrel races existed, the elvish race was in danger. She vowed to destroy these threats, and imbued herself and her loyal with the very essence of night and shadow, binding arcane power into the very fiber of their beings. They called themselves shadow elves, to represent the mark of shadow they 
had taken upon themselves. Many elves, however, protested, saying that such whole scale destruction was counter to every teaching of their gods, and could not be permitted.

Lilith would not be persuaded by such cowardly arguments, and set about smiting the enemies of the elves in earnest, massacring not just armies, but settlements, kingdoms, destroying them to the last babe. Her exploits became crueler and crueler, taking more and more delight in grinding non elves under her heel. Elven leaders and pacifists demanded that she cease, she disregarded them. At last members of the Aeiris Synedra confronted her personally and demanded her retirement and pursuit of non military interests. She laughed in their face, and despite their power, struck them all down. Enraged by this treasonous, incomprehensible act of evil, the elvish race rose to destroy her, only to be bested again and again by the general and those still loyal to her. Making light of their attempts, she set out on an campaign through the Underearth to destroy one of the ancient and great lineages of dwarves, burning them to death in their underground homes, and driving the remnants of their race onto the surface of the frozen north to die. When she attempted her return home, she discovered a massive elven host prepared for her. Elvish legend says that the avatar of Ale’vandra herself stood beside the armies of high elves, and truly, since the most experienced and battle hardened soldiers were on the side of Lilith, it may be true that divine assistance was given to the high elves that day.

The earth was thick coated in elven blood before the power mad general was cornered by the powerful mage priests of Ale’vandra. Seemingly doomed, Lilith called forth a dangerous spell that ripped open a shadowy vortex, consuming the general and her attackers. Without her, the shadow elves were scattered into the dark corners of Icara. Their cause seemed lost….until the voice of Lilith once again began to whisper to them from the darkness. Granting them divine strength, Lilith once again brought her faithful from the brink of death to build the strength necessary to destroy the enemies of a perfect world….enemies that now included elvish goddesses’ as well as the mongrel races.

Lilith is considered an evil Goddess. Few societies recognize or allow her worship, and she is not allied with other gods or goddesses. Though her priests will occasionally also worship or pay respect to Jarallan, Tyra, Magus, or elemental gods and goddesses, they worship and recognize no other gods except as part of a stratagem or to fulfill a short term goal. Despite this, worshippers of Lilith do not count most elves as her enemies…though Ale’vandra and her followers hold a special place of contempt in their hearts.
