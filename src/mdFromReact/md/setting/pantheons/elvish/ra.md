## Ethos

The God Ra is the god of the Sun, Eternity, or Knowledge. He is often depicted as a tall, golden skinned humanoid, with no nose, mouth or ears, and 
blazing golden eyes. Ra can also be displayed as any of the races of the creatures worshipping him. Ra is associated with the eagles, falcons and hawks, and has also been known to appear as a blinding light with a booming voice.

Ra’s makes no overt demands of his followers. It is the challenge of his followers to determine the correct way to act to accomplish their ascension into the heavens. Upon death, all beings are said to either ascend into the celestial heavens or descend into the damned caverns of the earth (known as the Underworld,) based upon what they have proven of their own worthiness. Each level of the celestial sphere is reserved for those who have earned it, and the amount of knowledge and wisdom needed to pass each level increases as the mortal ascends. The faithful of Ra are therefore forever weighing 
themselves against these unknown barriers, trying to increase their own worthiness in the holy Sun’s eyes.

Most worshippers consider Ra the only true god, though the goddess Isis is sometimes considered acceptable as well, even if she is not seen as Ra’s 
equal. Isis is considered to be either a messenger, lover or concubine, and like all other “gods” she is considered to be a mortal that have ascended  into the celestial sphere or descended into the lower spheres of Icara and the Underworld. Dragons, demon lords, elemental forces and angelic consorts are all considered to be the denizens of the celestial or underworld escaped onto Icara.

As the exact means of this ascension is not spelled out in doctrine, the practice of ascension varies greatly between different cultures. Some cultures 
believe the Sun god smiles upon strength, physical perfection and bravery in the face of conflict, in these cultures, worship of the Sun god is much like
worshiping a god of battle. Other cultures consider Ra to most respect knowledge and wisdom. In these cultures scholars are venerated as priests. Other’s believe that to ascend, one much transcend that which is earthly, must overcome mortal appetites and become more like the eternal one himself. These varying religious ideologies may all be in place in the same culture, such as the Sun elf culture, where both the wise and the strong are considered close to god through their actions.

## Worship

Priests of Ra most often attempt to divine information through the interpretation of the heavens, either through sundials or other intricate observations of sunbeams, or through the interpretation of the stars and meteors. Temples to Ra often involve gold and fire, both considered sacred by the worshippers of the Sun god. It is not uncommon for a priest or warrior of Ra to wear a golden disk upon the forehead or displayed prominently on the chest. These are considered holy symbols to the god. Also, jewelry that holds a fire ruby is also considered blessed and holy by many sects of the god. The worshippers often wear cotton robes and clothing.

While primarily worshipped by above surface humanoid races such as humans, elves and rakasha, he has also found favor amidst the Dynastan because
of the close ties between the Sun elves and the Dynastans. Ra is also much more prominently worshipped in tropical and desert climates than in
winter lands. Many subterranean races such as orcs, dwarves, dark elves, and similar creatures often face prejudice and distrust by worshippers of Ra, as
divinity and goodness is often depicted by geographic distance between good (sky, heaven) and evil (underground, underdark.)

## History

Ra is an Elder god. Worshippers of Ra state that he created Icara by speaking the secret names of each creature and animal, bringing them into existence.
Many of the beliefs of the followers of Ra would be considered blasphemous by other religions, as his religion is nearly monotheistic in nature, excluding true godhood to Ra himself. However, followers of Ra feel no need to correct or convert others, as many are turned inward, evaluating and guiding their own spiritual progression. For this reason, they are rarely in conflict with other priesthoods.
