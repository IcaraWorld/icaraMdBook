# Ale’vandra - Goddess of Magic

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

Goddess of Magic. Goddess of the Arcane, Lady of Secrets.

## Ethos

Ale’vandra is the Goddess of all magic. A mercurial force of immense power, Ale’vandra suffers even
more confusion than Tyra in her description by her faithful. She has been alternately called the wife of
Jarallan, or the sister of Tyra, or child of them both. Others state that she is not a singular entity, but
the mystical connection of all living things. Others state that she is the embodiment of order in the
universe.

Like Tyra before her, Ale’vandra has captured many more worshippers than elves alone. Ale’vandra’s
name is whispered in hushed tones by a legion of faithful, from good servants seeking the
responsible use of the arcane gifts to power mad devils seeking to wrench the flaming glory from her
hands and hold it over their subjects like a black hooded executioner.

## Worship

From her actual priesthood, Ale’vandra demands responsibility and structure. She demands
self-sacrifice, and supreme dedication. Above all, she demands secrecy. Ale’vandra does not give up
her secrets willingly. She does not allow her priests to freely share them. Teaching is allowed, but not
encouraged, and constant tests gauge the worthiness of each new student. The faithful of Ale’vandra
are men and women of few words, quick wits, and iron patience, patience born of a lifetime of waiting
for the sweet drop of knowledge to fall from the leaf while restraining yourself from grabbing the
branch and shaking the drop free.

Ale’vandra’s temples are always well maintained, beautiful things, for so many seek to trade treasure
for the power in the hands of the faithful. Judging by the temples, Ale’vandra herself must be fond of
gems, jewels, gold and silver. There are temples to Ale’vandra in almost every major city, whether
they are public places where people can go beg service or great towers of Arcane worship open only
to the faithful themselves. Ale’vandra is considered a neutral god, and her worship is forbidden in
quite a few places that fear the power that the Lady of Secrets might unveil.

## History

While the origins of Ale’vandra are unclear, a traditional elvish legend claims that Ale’vandra was an
elf of extraordinary beauty during the first age, that captured the heart of the creator himself. When
the elf maiden coupled with the divine spirit of the Highest, it set her ablaze with power. She did not
show the same restraint with this divine might that Jarallan did, however, spreading the forbidden
secrets of the arcane to all corners of Icara, drawing the elves away from the simplicity of their
destined perfect existence with whispers of unending power. Power that was only meant for the
highest was spread to all the elves, and from there it spread to the humans, the dwarves, and the
orcs, beckoning unspeakable things into the world and corrupting many. It is said that many centuries
later, a contrite Ale’vandra did her best to re-conceal and retake that which she had foolishly flaunted
in her youth, but by that time it was spread through the whole world, and all of Icara was nearly ripped
apart as she sought to contain that which had been given freely.

This likely speaks of her legendary battle with the mightiest of the mage kings, Magus, the man who
would stand in defiance of the gods themselves, or of her destruction of Lilith, but may also refer to
various times in the history of world where agents of Ale’vandra or the avatar of Ale’vandra herself
appeared to staunch the unfettered use of magic.
