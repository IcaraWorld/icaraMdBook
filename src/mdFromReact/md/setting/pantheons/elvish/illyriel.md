## Ethos

Illyriel is an elven Goddess who seeks the reintegration of the elvish race, seeking to merge all the
various schisms that formed during the second age. She also seeks reconciliation of various other
races, and is generally called upon or prayed to by those seeking peace for two countries as war, or
mercy for the unfortunate. Illyriel is also prayed to by musicians, singers, and other performers, and
is seen as a patron and guardian of beautiful music and song.

## Worship

Priests and Priestesses of Illyriel tend to either be peacemakers, negotiators, or neutral sites of rest
and recovery for both sides of a conflict. Occasionally, they will take a stiffer role, and they are not
above acting as an enforcer or armed guard if it assists the greater good. Alternately, worshippers are
bards or traveling singers, spreading the general word of harmony and bringing hope to besieged and
war-torn areas.

The beliefs of Illyrielsâ€™ faithful are fairly simple. They believe that war is a meaningless and brutal
exercise in futility that only spawns more war and conflict. They seek to bring peace, beauty and
simplicity into peoples lives wherever they can.

## History

Illyriel is a historical figure of the Third Age. There is some debate as to whether she was a high elf
who occasionally magically wore the guise of a dark elf or vice versa, but she was a well known
travelling songstress, whose songs could supposedly soften the hardest of hearts, to move the most
malignant of souls. Using her powerful voice as a uniting force, she sought to resolve many long
standing disagreements, doing what she could to bring together warring peoples and bring relief to a
region sorely needing the voice of reason after the Age of Blood. She often travelled with Venus, and
is tied to the Goddess in worship by some. She is famous for attempting to bring the elvish peoples
back together at that time, seeking to heal the rifts that were caused in the bloody civil war that split
them to begin with. Whether she could be called successful is a matter of opinion, for though the
elvish races rarely come to war against each other any more, the deep feelings of betrayal that exist
on both sides have not been forgotten or forgiven.
