# Isis - Goddess of Secrets

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

Goddess of Secrets, Goddess of the Night, Maiden of Ra, Goddess of the Moon

## Ethos

The Goddess of the night, or secrets, of mystery, Isis is depicted as a tall, beautiful woman with flowing hair and a veil of stars. Her eyes 
are endless depths, beautiful to behold and fall into. Her garb is often depicted as silk scarves, and she is described as a beguiling and 
seductive woman.

The Goddess Isis is a goddess of kept secrets and given power. She is worshipped by those who seek power, ambitious individuals, or 
simply those who do not want to pay the price of their indiscretion in Ra’s eyes. Station and achievement are very important to those who 
pray to the Goddess of Mystery. Only women may be priestess of Isis, and the ceremonies to her are private, and unavailable to the 
uninitiated or the unbeliever. However, any may worship her, and many who thrive on knowledge and secret power do so, as she is 
said to bestow power and secret magic upon her worshippers.

## Worship

The tenants of Isis command obedience, and respect. Unlike her lover Ra, she has very specific demands of her worshippers, that 
demand elaborate worship ceremonies, sacrifices to her of money, possessions, time in the form of quests and participation in the 
interests of Isis. Many of these acts do not sit well with other goodly religions, not so much because they are evil, but because many
rumored ceremonies of Isis are sexual or immoral in nature. And the priestess of Isis, as ambitious and political as the one they serve,
never hesitate to ask for sacrifice, no matter how the uninitiated may whisper, for such acts are simply worship, and hold no personal
import for the priestess. A priestess may ask a king to lead his armies against a distant kingdom, for some perceived insult of the goddess.
Or demand a newly married man or woman sleep with a priestess of Isis prior to consummating their marriage bed in exchange for a
blessing to the union. Isis demands the devotion of the worshipper above all other things in that worshipper’s life.

Isis is worshipped in conjunction with Ra. While not all worshippers of Ra accept Isis as a goddess, all worshippers of Isis also believe in
Ra. Those who follow her believe that she alone has the ear of the Sun God, and the Lady of Midnight alone can hide transgressions 
from the all seeing Eye of Ra. Since she is such a demanding goddess for that protection, the male worshippers are a very superstitious lot, ready to throw a quick appeasement to her whenever they feel the need of her assistance.

## History

Isis is a very old goddess indeed, and many call her an Elder goddess. They say that when Ra first created Icara, he was ever 
vigilant, searing Icara and all of its inhabitants with his ever seeing eye, cursing them with eternal daylight and no rest. Isis took pity on
the young creatures, and seduced Ra away each evening, leaving him to sleep the sleep of the sated each night and giving the
creatures of Icara blessed respite. Others simply say that Isis was a power hungry mortal that seduced the god Ra to gain unimaginable 
power. Scholars that do not worship the god have claimed that the legends of Ra, Jarallan, Isis and Ale’vandra are related pointing to the 
parallels in them, but priests of all sects deny a connection.
