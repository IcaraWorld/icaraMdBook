## Titles

Patron God of the Elves

## Ethos

One of the Elder God’s, Jarallans influence is felt often in lands where elves live. Jarallan very rarely
directly influences his people or worshippers, but the spells of his priesthood are strong and those
blessed with his presence will attest to the strength of the deity. High Elves believe it is from Jarallan
that all other things have spread, and that he is the father to the rest of their gods, their race, the
elements themselves, and the very land of Icara. Jarallan is often called the Guiding Hand or guiding
light, and his worshippers often do not directly utter his name, feeling it blasphemous. As such, many
others do not speak or do not even know the name of Jarallan, since his worshippers do not seek
converts. Knowledge of the elf lord is considered precious, and most edicts and prophecies are
closely guarded secrets.

## Worship

The beliefs that are known are very straightforward. The elvish principles of stewardship of the land,
of magic, and of even other peoples are the strongest in those that believe most faithfully in Jarallan.
Elves who follow him consider it their duty to educate, protect, and better the world. It is in this spirit
that the forests are tended and grow lusher, that the animals live in great numbers, and there are few
more prosperous places than the homelands of the elves. Some elves take this to mean the
education of the world, and roam the lands as tutors or advisors. Some take this to mean the
destruction of harmful things, and act as protectors from a particular bane, such as dark magic, or
undead, or demonic meddling. However, many outsiders resent the complete control the faithful claim
to have a divine right to, and those who do not comply with the divine wisdom of the priests of
Jarallan are subject to it precise and uncompromising justice.

While their ideals are pure and good, in practice, the results can appear almost devilish. When a
human farmers wheat farm is burned to the ground because it is upsetting the local ecosystem, or
when an orc tribe is “thinned” to control the numbers, it is hard to think of Jarallan with love. Truly, the
god’s edicts can be dangerous as well as beneficial. It was following a twisted version of Jarallan’s
doctrine that caused the dark elves to decide humans and orcs should be cast off the mortal coil.

The vast majority of the god’s worshippers are elves, with a smattering of other races thrown in. Of
the elves, high elves are most prominent, with Sun and Wood elves, then Shadow and Gray Elves
worshipping him in respectively smaller and smaller numbers. The priesthood of Jarallan will allow the
worship of non-elves, but they do not hold any places of import within the religion.

## History

Jarallan and Odin are the first of all recorded gods. Jarallans worshippers claim that not only did
Jarallan create the elves, but also the world Icara itself, as well as all the other races, elements,
natural creatures and even gods that live on the planet. Jarallan’s worship has been at the heart of
many wars, and he is often called upon when war comes to the elves, but he is considered a good
god by most elf and non-elf alike. Though imperious, his priests are helpful so long as they believe
that they are not hindering the will of their all wise deity by doing so. Any foes of Jarallan, however,
are dealt with swiftly and without mercy
