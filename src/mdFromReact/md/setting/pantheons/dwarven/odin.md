Patron God of the Dwarves, The Forge Keeper, The All Father

## Ethos

Odin is the favored deity of the craftsman, being it a blacksmith or carpenter. Odin preaches a strict sense of family and of honorable service to one's king, religion, and family. The Forge Keeper expects his followers to be steadfast and determined above all things.

The religion of the dwarves thrives on not complaining, persevering through difficulty, and being honorable in all things. Faithfulness and fidelity are espoused by the priests of Odin, as are temperance of spirit and action. A dwarf is cautioned never to act too swiftly, either in joy or in anger, and to be as a rock for family, friends, and clan. A dwarf is always reminded that they must serve their king first, their father second, their spouse and family third, their friends fourth, and themselves last.

## Worship

The priests of Odin are a huge part of the dwarven community. They host gatherings, provide charity as they see it necessary, and counsel dwarves in need. A priesthood calling is not a full time job for any but the most sacred and highest calling, and most priests also serve another function in the community as well, be it baker or soldier. Priests strive to lead by example as much as anything, and consider their actions the model for the community as large. Dwarven priests seek to inspire their fellow dwarf. They are famous for their hymns, deep throated songs sung in unison, which echo and reverberate through the very stone of the earth. They are also famous for their whiskey. Dwarvish Holy Water is stern stuff, thick-bodied and dark like the earth itself. Dwarves view it as the water of life, believing that the sacred brew they create was used at the dawn of time to awaken the stones themselves. Dwarven brewmasters are trained for years, and only after having been ordained by a high priest of Odin are they allowed to create the consecrated intoxicant that is considered the sacred brew of Odin. It is commonly drunk during ceremonies and during dwarvish religion services. Priests expect their parishioners to be somber and reflective during the services, whether drunk or sober, and rude or boisterous activity is to be saved for the drinking hall, not the chapel. In the drinking hall, however, it is considered proper form to live life to the fullest, and enjoy those blessings that Odin has given to the dwarvish people.

Dwarven priests consider coin gathered in their coffers money being handed to them for stewardship, and they seek to use it on the community first. The job-holding priests use their own money for upkeep of the temples of Odin, and to see to their own needs. Because they put the needs of the community over that of their clergy, the priests of Odin are highly respected by many, despite their intoxicating worship ceremonies, and Odin is a welcome presence in the majority of cities.

## History

Odin is an Elder god. Like Jarallan, he was granting strength to his faithful before history was being recorded. The dwarves claim that he created Icara, shaping it on his great Forge, then crafting the creatures out of clay and imbuing life in them with his life-giving elixir - potent, god-brewed liquor. He then set them about their work. These were the first dwarves. Dwarves then claim that Odin created other creatures to cover Icara. They don't often believe that Odin created the other people of Icara, believing all gods created their own peoples to inhabit the perfect world that Odin created, but a few do allow that "a tip too many of the flask would account for the elves, after all".

Odin is a fairly demanding god, expecting his people to ever strive for personal perfection and ever=greater heights of service to others. Many a snide dwarf has commented on the irony that the dwarf strictly sets out rules of behavior for himself, ever seeking to govern their own impulses, while the elf sets out rules of behaviors for others and caters to their own impulses whenever the fancy strikes. Odin's strict rules on tradition and fealty leave little wiggle room for change, and his doctrine has stayed consistent for centuries.
