## Worship

Thor is the god associated with battle, tempest, lightning, thunder, chaos, and bravery. Prayers are offered to him generally in times of dire need, or in times when courage is needed. Thus, he is often prayed to by soldiers of the eve of a dangerous battle, or during a time of great hardship (such as when a mine collapses, or another natural disaster threatens). Dwarves tend to evoke Thor's name whenever there is any sort of elemental disaster, from fire and frost to lightning or flash floods.

Thor's worship includes deep drinking as a religious exercise. The taunts and jeers raised in a drinking hall usually invoke his name. Dwarves who would never take Odin's name in vain even on pain of death will swear at Thor until they're blue in the face without a second thought. There is little held sacred about Thor, but dwarves have much respect for the lightning thrower.

### Temples

Thor rarely has his own temples. He will often have an altar in Odin's temple, or small shrines at fortresses, castles, or other military outposts. Many priests of Odin respect and encourage worship of Thor, though more paladins and fighters worship Thor than priests do.

## History

Thor first made his presence known in the Age of Blood, during the Titan Wars. He made a great name for himself as a dwarvish champion. He wasn't so much a brilliant tactician as an unstoppable warrior, who smashed the giants and ogres as if they were kindling, wading through lines of enemies with devastating efficiency. Thor was a tireless combatant who cheerfully slew enemies from sunrise to sunset, according to the dwarven legends. If he was angered, he became even more ferocious, smashing his foes with great claps of thunder and splitting them with lightning strikes. Thor was at the forefront of the offensive that eventually killed the titan who was leading the armies against dwarven kind. His ascension took place in the titan's enormous palace, as Thor used his hammer to smash the giant's tremendous greatsword, and then blasted the titan's skull with the very next swing. Witnesses say that Thor simply rose up afterwards, crackling with power, until a tremendous lightning bold split the earth where he floated. When the smoke cleared, Thor was gone, never to be seen in the worldly realm again.

Many dwarves do not believe that Thor was ever truly mortal. They believe that he is the son of Odin, come to Icara against his father's wishes to help contain the threat to his father's people, and that he returned to his father after the threat was destroyed. There has never been any official dispute to this by the high priests of Odin, but many scholars state that even if a dwarf had ascended, the stubborn and traditional-minded dwarves would work to tie the new god into their existing religion anyway.
