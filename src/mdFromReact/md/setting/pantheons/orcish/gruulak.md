## Titles

Gruulak (Orc-father), Trruka (The Relentless Rampaging Beast), Bonesnapper, Grzkal (The Pained Frenzy), The Butcher,

## Ethos

The God of the Orcs, Gruulak, is considered the creator or the patriarch of the orc, goblinoid and brutish races. He is the embodiment of wanton
destruction, wasted life, and primal fury. Gruulak does not drive his followers or his people toward a specific higher purpose, seeming to be
reveling in bloodshed and slaughter for the sole purpose of bloodshed and slaughter.

## Worship

Orcs and goblinoids that are devoted children of the orc-father show their devotion by torturing captives to death. Often, this happens on the field
of battle - cutting the hands, feet, and identifying features such as lips, ears and noses from their victims and castrating the males. The lucky ones
die then - a captive that is taken back to a shaman of Gruulak can be tortured for days, with bones smashed to shards, limbs racked and rended
into shapes beyond recognition, flesh flayed, carved and branded in an attempt to receive prophecy or omens from the Butcher. They can also
look for signs or omens based on weather patterns and animal sacrifice, but the blood sacrifice of an enemy can be used as crowd-pandering
entertainment or to incite its followers into a blood frenzy. A distant third use is actually gathering of life-force for use in rituals as many other dark religions use it. Prisoners are often simply tortured to death for the delight of the crowd and to appease tradition.

Believers in Gruulak are scourges that do not believe in building upon - they pillage, loot, and scorch the earth behind them. Many followers of
Gruulak use his “prophecies” to further their own individual power schemes. As stated, some worshipers believe that they will meet him in the afterlife, and only the strongest that they will meet all these are convinced there are no other gods for them, that only the Bonesnapper truly would accept them. Targeted so often by crusaders of other gods, scorned by men, elves and dwarves, they know the only afterlife they have for themselves is in the killing fields of Gehenna. They must live long, to prolong their time away from these hellish plains of endless war and suffering. They must live strong, and bring their enemies low before they send them to the afterlife, less they face them there again. (Hence the breaking of enemies before their death.) For all of these worshippers, their is no joy in their gods - there is only hatred. Hatred of themselves, their god, other orcs, and hatred, jealously and envy of the other races who seem pre-ordained to be blessed in the afterlife.

Many orcs actively resent Gruulak, his worship, and his way of life, considering him a curse that has been thrust upon them, and reject him,
seeking to subjugate the anger and hate that they've been cursed with, which they refer to as the mark of Gruulak.

## History

Gruulak is considered an Elder God, based on his longevity, but he does not have the strength, continuity, or faith base that many other Elder
Gods enjoy. Because of the uncertain nature of worship, many orcs that have become more civilized or more structured worship other gods, and
even orcs that call to Gruulak will often worship an elemental god or other force of greater chaos as well. However, traditional tribes and clans of
orcs that have maintained their monstrous heritage still answer the call of Gruulaks.
