## Titles

Glorious Dawnbringer, Lord of Heaven, The Golden God, The Voice and The Fury, The Lightbringer

## Ethos

Teancu expects a strict and strident path for his people of bravery and unwavering loyalty. He exhorts them to be ever vigilant of evil, to burn out the wicked among them, to banish heretics, and put evil to sword. He expects them to bring glory and power to his name, and to raise the state of Icara to that of the High Heavens.

## Worship

Teancu's tenants are simply stated. Purification. Sanctification. Glorification. The radiant Lord of the Heavens exhorts his followers to eradicate the non-divine in their midst, both of the infernal taint of the abyss, evil or sinful peoples or things, and conversion of those deluded by false gods and prophets. Worshippers themselves must reject non-divine thoughts and power. Those thus purified must sanctify themselves through the total dedication and submission to the Holy Hosts of Heaven. The peoples and lands of the faithful must then be glorified by civilizing and ordering hte world, building strong homes and castles, wide road, mighty cities, and building grand temples of gold, marble, silver, and crystal to commune with their god and his angelic servants.

## Hierarchy of the Church

The church of Teancu is generally ordered differently dependent on who is in charge. The two main arms of the church are the priests and the templars. The titles of whom will depend upon their roles within the church.

### Templars

The knights of Teancu, these men are trained in physical combat and the tactics or war. They are tasked with protecting the faithful of Teancy and destroying corruption, be it demonic, infernal, fel, or mortal in origin.

- Inquisitors - These Templars have dedicated their life to snuffing out evil and corruption wherever it may be found. They do not recognize a higher moral authority than the celestials themselves, and as a result answer to no one within the church. They do not maintain temples, they maintain personal fortresses that they may use as bastions of strength to rally forth and smite evil.
    - Grand Inquisitor - A respected, feared, and successful Templar who has gathered a following of other Templars/Inquisitors and maintains a stronghold. This should not be confused with a Templar who leads a temple - Inquisitors do not lead temples.
    - Exalted Inquisitor - The title of an accomplished Inquisitor who has not yet established a stronghold. In a company of Templars, only one may be the Grand Inquisitor, but the others may well be Exalted.
    - Inquisitor - The title of a Templar of Teancu that has dedicated himself to hunting and destroying corruption wherever he finds it.
- Temple Knights - These Templars have a more protective function, and are more common in lands that have a large presence of the faithful. Temple knights serve to protect the temples themselves, and occasionally the surrounding kingdoms. Temple knights also commonly will serve the priesthood directly, acting as a military force to protect or empower them.
    - Grand Commander - The leader of the mortal standing armies of Teancu, the grand commander is in charge of all standing temple knights from all the of the surrounding temples. In time of great strife, the existing Holy Commanders will elect a Grand Commander.
    - Holy Commander - If a Templar is placed in charge of a temple, above all other priests or Templars, he is named Holy Commander.
    - Exalted Templar - A Knight Templar that has been chosen to lead knights in battle, or one that has a special place beside the church leadership of the temple, be it the Holy Commander or a priest.
    - Knight Templar - A Templar who has proven to be skilled in battle, and the deadly edge of the military force. Knight Templars are almost always cavalry or divinely empowered in some other way.
    - Templar - The Templars form the backbone of both the temple defenses and of any military presence the followers of Teancu have. Faithful worshippers of Teancu that have skill or desire to become warriors of the faith are trained in combat and drilled in spiritual beliefs until deemed fit by a Templar, at which point they are anointed Templars.

### Priests

The priests of Teancu are accountable to spread the teachings of Teancu, divine the will of the celestials (or host, as they call them), and protect the followers of Teancu from the evils of corruption. They are by and large responsible for the governance of the church, specifically the collecting and spending of tithes and gifts to the church, as well as the multiplication of the faithful. Priests fall into numerous categories, depending on their function.

#### Intercessor

#TODO

#### Confessor

#TODO

- Messenger - Priests who speak to the hosts, and then convey their messages to the faithful. Messengers act as the divine mouthpieces of the celestials.
    - Exalted Herald - A priest who has risen to great esteem as a seer and oracle, who is considered to speak for the celestial hosts and has been granted a position of leadership in the church as a result. Heralds are rare, but can rise to positions of unparalleled power in the church, simply because their word is considered the word of the hosts.

## History

Teancu was a powerful Celestial of the second age, one of the first Gods of humans that answered the planar calls into the rifts emanating from the Metoc Kingdoms. Teancu released his angelic hosts into Icara to fight the demonic hordes of Chaos and call upon mortal to answer a higher call than that of nation or blood - he called them to create kingdoms and temples, holy orders or worshippers that would pledge their soulds and lives to the cause of the righteous.

His angels drew many to the cause, and his legions of loyal swelled. Unfortunately, the war between angels and demons rousted the true dragons of Icara, and Teancu's followers were purged along with the tribes of Chaos. Since then, he has taken a less active role in the salvation of Icara - but his faithful are sill pulled under his protective wing, and his true believers have not stopped exalting his name.
