# Shiva - Goddess of Water

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

Goddess of Water, Ruler of the Swirling Seas, Goddess of Frost/Ice, Frost/Ice Queen, The Wise Winter Queen, The Secret Holder

## Ethos

The varying nature of the Water Goddess ensures that she is called upon by all manner of worshippers from evil cults to merciful priests.
To many creatures she is a goddess of life, the guardian of the precious moisture that makes life possible. This worship is most common in desert or agricultural settings. To the sea-dwelling denizens of Icara, Shiva is often considered a fickle and ruthless goddess, called upon for both luck and cursed in fear depending on the weather and will of the winds. The worshipers of the north refer to her as the Frost or Ice Queen, and will often pray to her in the depth of winter. Sentient undead will often worship her under this name, and they as well as others who hurl dark magic may consider her 
Death itself.

## Worship

Rituals for Shiva vary depending on which of her aspects is being worshipped. Religions that consider her a life goddess generally focus on baptisms and ceremonial sacraments of water, along with communal meals. This aspect of Shivaâ€™s worship often focuses on renewal of life and life cycles. Worshippers of a sea goddess are just as likely to toss a curse as a prayer to Shiva, and their offerings tend to be material in nature. Worshippers of the Frost Queen tend to believe her a beautiful, vain, a cold, and deadly deity. These may worship her simply out of respect for her calculated nature, and pray 
to deaden their passions, emotions, or mortal fears. They also may pray for power only, and the arcane exhortations that drive their dread frost spells are their only true source of communion with their goddess. Worshippers from all walks of life may believe in blessed springs or wishing wells, and their sacrifices vary depending on their local legends.
