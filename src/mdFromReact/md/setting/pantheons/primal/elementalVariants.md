# Elemental Pantheon Variant Worship

## Godhead - Elder Elementals

The elder races that believe that all elementals are descended from Tyra, or that dwarf and elves were fae descended from the elemental 
dominions, worship a very different elemental pantheon. The children of Tyra are described as two sets of twins - twin elves and twin dwarves. These gods and goddesses are depicted with much more humanity, guilty of vice and vanity and hubris intact. 

The water son is depicted as a caring elven male named **Shavar**, a gentle god who works to nurture the land and people within it. A stoic soul, he is the warden of the seasons, helping his mother bring the winter frost or the hot summers of Icara. Shavar is endlessly patient with the antics of his twin sister, **Aviana**, a cheerful, flighty and generous elven female, who spreads joy and merriment, often without thought to the future, and one who can get quite careless with the world when she is caught up in a mood. She gets along well with **Pyragar**, a hot-headed dwarf, a genius master craftsman and braggart who works the world forge. Prone to fits of brilliance, rage or destruction followed by periods of deep remorse and sullen inactivity, Pyragar represents reckless rage and power, as well as ambition and pride. His sister **Gursula**, the elemental goddess of Earth, is a quiet and portly dwarf, one who balances her brothers reckless nature with her own endless calm and wisdom. She is seen as a great baker, builder, matron and engineer, She represents civilization and tradition. 

## Sacred Sisters Godhead

There are a number of druids, witches and warlocks that worship the elementals directly, believing that the four key elements of fire, water, air, and earth are goddesses of tremendous power, who are joined and unified in the protection of Icara. The four goddesses serve together to form the primal powers. They include:

- **Aviana** - a wind sylph who acts as the all seeing watcher and messenger to both her sisters and their followers. Aviana may communicate in the stead of any of her sisters, and she grants physical speed and mental cunning to her faithful. Those who are blessed by her are “quickened” beyond their own abilities. She acts as the advocate of people and represents diplomacy and wisdom. 
- **Gaia** - an earth sylph whose wisdom and patience weighs oaths and promises, and acts as the lawkeeper of the Godhead. She is the force that withstands and endures, and called upon when endurance and stoicism are needed. She is understood as the bedrock of nature.
- **Shiva** - a sharp tongued and calculating ice sylph, who governs death, decay, and destruction. She is both transcendent and unchangeable. She is called upon by those who seek implacable strength and depthless knowledge, and is known to be the spirit of the unknown and the unknowable.
- **Pyria** - a tremendously vain fire sylph who represents courage, the hunt, hunger, and passion. She is the awe inspiring but short-lived height of beauty and power, and the guardian of birth, renewal, and life.
