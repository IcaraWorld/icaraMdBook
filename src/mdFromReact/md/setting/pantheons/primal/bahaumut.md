# Bahaumut - God of Order

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

God of Order, Father of Dragons, Scales of Balance

## Ethos

Almost all who have seen or met the mighty Father of the Dragons will swear to his divinity, and there is no question that those who call to him for aid seem to have divine inspiration for their casting, for Bahaumut is one God who never appears as avatar. Bahaumut himself who comes calling if the 
whim is upon him. A living, breathing, more tangible God one could not ask for, Icara itself is his home. A beast of immense size, the wingspan of the Lord of Dragons is rumored to block the very sun. Alternately described as a tremendous beast of the purest platinum or a shimmering kaleidoscope of colors, Bahaumut spends most of his time curled patiently beneath the earth. Many worshipers claim that he sleeps at the very core of Icara, and the life of the planet itself is tied to his deep thrumming heartbeat.

It is impossible to state what Bahaumut stands for, though his hatred of the infernal demons and the Lord of Chaos seem to lend him the title of a good god, and the title of a god of Order. The dual nature of his children have granted him the title of a god of balance. It is important to note that many 
kingdoms do not in any way support the dragon worship however, since it leads all too often to the undermining or destruction of kingdoms regardless of the aspects worshiped. Order in Bahaumut’s view is natural order. Balance is natural balance. Many proud kingdoms have been thrown down in the name of the Dragon Lord, but with the god himself under the earth and his powerful children everywhere, no king is fool enough to openly oppress their worshipers. Let sleeping dragons lie is the wisest of sayings.

## Worship

The worshipers of Bahaumut are varied. Foremost among them are the ancient dragons, immortal and supremely powerful in their own right. There are ten races of dragon-kind considered to by “true” dragons, that recognize each other as equals. These are the metallic dragons, the gold, the silver, the 
bronze, the copper, and the brass. Then there are the chromatic, the red, the blue, the black, the white and the green. The dragons may war against each other, as is natural, but most serve their wise ancestor. Beyond these are the many mortal worshipers of Bahaumut. 

Direct followers of the God of Order seem to have very little in the way of organized beliefs. What scholars have noted, however, in instances too overwhelming to be coincidence, is that these followers, whether dragon or mortal, seem most interested in preserving balance in the world. Cities 
that get too large, armies that get overly ambitious, religions run amok, all seem to inevitably be involved in the undermining cults worshipping draconic gods, casualties of dragon rampages, or otherwise facing opposition from something with ties to the God of Balance. Of course, some of the 
world’s biggest threats have gone unchecked by Bahaumut, leaving religious scholars confused about the god’s motives.

## History

Bahaumut has been a part of recorded history since the Second Age. It seems likely that he has always been in Icara. He is best known for the purge of demonic races from Icara during the Second Age, but even today travelers claim to have stumbled upon the lair of the Father of Dragons.

## Variant Worship – Dragon Worship

Many cultists worship one of the many dragon children of Bahaumut. Each dragon holds a place on the mighty scale of order, each a symbol of two aspects of mortal behavior, according to the worshippers of the Dragon Lord. The dragons embody ten virtues and ten vices: 

**Vices:**
- White dragons embody sorrow and despair, and can be called upon by necromancers and the broken hearted and down trodden. 
- Black dragons symbolize deceit and cruelty, and are often the patron wyrms of assassins, thieves and corrupt men. 
- Green dragons symbolize lust and envy, and are called upon by jealous and amorous mortals alike. 
- Blue dragons embody avarice and gluttony, and many a good natured chef or greedy businessman will have a blue scale talisman.
- Red dragons embody pride and wrath, and are the desired guardians of warlords and kings.

**Virtues:** 
- Copper dragons embody the values of chastity and honesty. Young lovers will often give each other copper honor rings to show themselves true, or cast copper flakes upon water to determine whether a lover is true to them. 
- Iron dragons embody diligence and loyalty, and are favored of mercenaries and body guards. Secret societies of Iron dragon warriors fight on both sides of conflicts, with only a few secret signals to know each other by. 
- Bronze dragons, the symbols of wisdom and patience, are inspirations to scholars and wizards. 
- Silver dragons, the embodiments of benevolence and hope, are called upon by many goodly races to cure blights and find luck.
- Gold dragons, symbols of courage and justice, are idolized of kings and warriors, just as their red cousins are.

The dragons themselves rarely acknowledge the mortal followers of their forbear. They will, however, acknowledge those who worship them directly, a very common phenomenon. Worshippers of individual dragons tend to espouse the values of that dragon, not of Bahaumut. For this reason, dragon cultists may be of any alignment and have any ideology. Cults of Gold dragons tend to be lawful good, Silver cults tend toward neutral good, Bronze are often chaotic good, Copper and Iron are lawful neutral. Red dragons are chaotic evil, Blue are lawful evil, Black and White are neutral evil, and green are Chaotic neutral. Of course, these are simply the tendencies of each dragon’s cult, individual dragons hold no rules of behavior for themselves or other dragons, and each will act as it sees fit at any given time. Whether this is because the ideals have been falsely thrust upon the wyrms by a hopeful populace or simply because the ancient beasts work in ways too confounding for mortals is anybodies guess.
