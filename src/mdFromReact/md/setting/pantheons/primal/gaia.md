## Titles

Goddess of the Earth, Primal Mother, Terra, God of the Earth, The Unyielding, Hob the Hidden

## Ethos and Worship

The Goddess/God of the Earth is worshipped by farmers and soldiers
alike. Those who do not have a specific creation story often believe
that all life sprung from Gaia herself. She is worshipped a tad more
zealously by those who would live in the earth or depend on the earth
for sustenance. She is often worshipped interchangeably with Tyra herself, and makes appearances in many local legends of the civilized
nations. Those who believe in her as a goddess tend to focus on her
as a goddess of life and nature.

Those who worship the God of Earth tend to worship as a god of
strength and stability. They may worship his unchanging nature,
ascribe wisdom, patience, or a calm temperament. They often believe
that Icara itself sits on the back of Gaus, an earth elemental of
tremendous size. The worshippers who fall in this category could be
artisans, builders, masons, or monks, scholars or, farmers as well.
They may be soldiers, or simply laborers.

Those in the Shadowdeep may worship Hob. Hob is depicted as a spirit or fae who walks unseen among the mortal realm, influencing the world. A trickster god, Hob can be kind or malicious, generous or greedy, depending on his whim. Hob is a common god to goblin and kobold tribes, and is sometimes called on by the powerless to beg for strength or help.
