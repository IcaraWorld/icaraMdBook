<!-- toc -->

## Titles

Goddess of Air, Queen of Storms

## Ethos

The Goddess of Air is worshipped by those who rely on weather, those
who rely on wind, and those would praise the destructive powers of
the skies. She is often treated as a goddess of whims and fickle
favor, and can be called upon as a goddess of chance. Worshippers
of Aviana may also worship lightning, thunder, or other aspects of
storms, and is favored and called upon by those who desire fleetness
of foot, speed of body, or accuracy. For that reason, she is the patron
goddess of runners, acrobats, archers, and similar athletes.

## Worship

Worship of the goddess tends to be verbal in nature, though offering
may be given. Since there is no physical manifestation of air, unlike
fire, water or earth, most worshippers consider eloquent speeches a
sufficient form of worship. Shrines to the wind goddess tend to be
high, on mountain passes, towers, or near caves where the wind can
make a physical impression of some sort. Primarily, Aviana is
worshipped by certain cults of elves, seafaring people, and avian
humanoids, in addition to receiving situational prayers from sailors
and farmers.
