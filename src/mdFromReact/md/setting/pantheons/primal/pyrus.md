# Pyrus - God of Fire / Pyria - Goddess of Fire

## Titles

God of Fire, Goddess of Fire, The Ashbringer, Lord of Flame

## Ethos

Pyrus represents the deification of the element of fire. Pyrus is often depicted as a towering column of fire, with humanoid features and shape for the upper body. Pyrus does not appear to have any specific ethos or creed, but inspires worship regardless.

## Worship

Worship of the elemental god of fire is not uncommon, but there is no universal religion. Some worshippers of the god refer to his flames as cleansing, these worshippers can be a human priesthood dedicated to cleansing a bane (such as undead or demonkind), or an orcish or Dynastan cult that is dedicated to cleansing a particular enemy of their people (such as humans or yuanti), or even a nature priest that believe in the period cleansing of the forest through wildfire.

Others who worship or call upon the fire spirits may do so for the sheer destructive power of flame. Often, these types of cults and religions are magic users or tribal leaders. The rituals of these worshippers vary greatly, from candle or torch lightings to live burnt offerings.

Alternately, many barbarian tribes worship Pyrus as the Ashbringer, a wrathful and murderous god who demands tribute paid to him in flame. These call upon Pyrus to trade life for life, to warm their own bones and extend the "living flame" of their soul by sacrificing weak or captured victims to him in elaborate rituals involving bonfires and covering their own bodies in soot or ash. They often seek a straight exchange of power for their obedience.
