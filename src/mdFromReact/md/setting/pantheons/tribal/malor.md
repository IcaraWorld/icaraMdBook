<!-- toc -->

## Titles

God of the Hunt, God of Assassination, Pack Lord, God of Murder, the Thirsty One, The Dark Hunter


## Ethos

In the southern jungles, the vicious God of the Hunt is a major deity, especially among the lizard men and the Yuanti. Their depictions of 
him are of a horrific crocodilian beast, carrying barbed spears with the dangling spines of his victims hanging from his weapons. They 
worship him with blood sacrifice, sacrificing the weak and the captured to ensure a good hunt, a successful raid, or to thank him for a particularly satisfying kill.

In badlands and wastelands around Icara, the starving and gluttonous Pack Lord is worshiped by ravenous beastmen as they hunt, sating his bloodlust with horrific feast rituals, where the victims are eaten alive and their desperate last screams offer prayers to the Thirsty One. They depict him as a tremendous shapeshifting wolf demon.

In the northern wilds, the sullen and secretive god of the Hunt is depicted as a stone faced ogrillion, razor sharp bones growing like talons from his hands and arms. He is offered ceremonial hunting kills from the orcs, ogres and goblinkind that worship him, a simple token of fealty that his priests demand of their followers to show respect to the grim deity, and pay respect to their prey.

In cities throughout the civilizations of man, he is depicted as an apex, primal humanoid with wickedly serrated blades dripping deadly poison, the god of assassins, professional killers, and serial murderers. Those who worship him take their victims in the name of the Dark Hunter, leaving bloody, eviscerated bodies in their wake.

## Worship

Worshippers of Malor tend to call him by a variety of names, and his nature varies depending on who is calling upon him. His worship is 
generally considered evil in human, dwarven, or Dynastan circles, as their most common experience is with his bloodthirsty followers or 
murdering sociopaths. Orcs, however, consider him a beneficent god, albeit one that is appeased by token sacrifice. Interestingly enough, 
orcish priests of Malor can be among the most peaceful of the religious orcs, and certain sects of their religion are much more interested in natural balance and harmony than followers of Grkazr or Skarik. For this reason wood elves and other races in close contact with these orcish tribes tend to consider him a peaceful god, in line with their own beliefs. At very best, however, Malor may be called neutral, and far more of his worshippers call upon a dark god of blood sacrifice and ritualistic killings.
