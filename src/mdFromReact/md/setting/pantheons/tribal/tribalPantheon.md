# Tribal Pantheons

Gods without a pantheon are worshiped by a wide variety of races, peoples and creatures, that do not seem to show favor to one race or 
another, or ones claimed by multiple races. Alternately, they can be entities about which there is either conflicting or misleading information, and scholars are unable to determine the true intentions of the god or goddess.
