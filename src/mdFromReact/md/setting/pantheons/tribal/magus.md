# Magus - God of Dark Magic

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

God of Dark Magic, God of Destiny, God of the Accursed, The God Slayer

## Ethos

Magus is a powerful being whose reach spreads across the planes. Magus’ creed, as mortal, and then as God, is to provide knowledge, 
to provide power, and let man and beast determine their own destiny. His power, unfortunately, has a price, a potentially fatal one. Magus 
will not save one who shoulders more than his body can handle, or one who looks at what his mind cannot fathom, or delves deeper into 
the darkness than the soul can withstand. All three of these things are in constant danger when one stands in the rushing river of power that 
the faithful of Magus submerge themselves in. It is up to the seeker to master that power, or drown in its wake.

## Worship

Magus’ religions can vary greatly depending on who his worshippers are. Many members of the monstrous races worship Magus, in widely 
variant religions. Some outcasts take revenge on civilizations in Magus’ name, others use his history of universal acceptance to try to 
bridge gaps between cultures. While he has a variety of religions that worship him, and few are truly considered “wrong” by the rest, his 
most traditional temples are focal points of magical power, with high priestesses of the medusae race, and high priests that are generally 
shapeshifters. It is not uncommon for a few angelic or demonic beings to reside in the temples of Magus, but it is uncommon for them to hold a place of authority.

Magus does not exhort his followers to action in matters of the world. He ever beckons them to stretch and improve themselves, and their abilities, and his religion seems entirely bent around the search for personal power, without a root cause. What may appear to be a crusade carried out in Magus’ name is more likely a vendetta of a high priest or influential member of a temple. Worshippers may be good or evil, dependent on their take on the worldshaper’s beliefs, or simply their own beliefs.

## History

Magus is a figure of the Fourth Age. As with Bane, there is an infuriating amount of contradiction of the historical Magus, which is 
supposed by some to be divine in nature. (It occurs to many historians that a figure such as Bane or Magus would benefit from having their history shrouded in secrecy, and that the desire for disinformation is not beyond the divine.) Records of the period refer to Magus as a human, or a dark elf, perhaps, or possibly a madear (a male medusae.) Others indicate that he was one of those races, but also lycanthrope, or shape shifter of another type, or a vampire.

What he was, however, is irrelevant to what Magus became – the mage king of Tarajah, a sorcerer of power unimagined by mortal man. He subjugated his enemies with a glance, shifted time and space with a flick of his wrist, crafted his entire world as he saw fit at any given moment. He used this power to shape an ideal society where any and all lived in complete freedom, unfettered by the morality and demands of others, free from almost all laws, a beautiful anarchy of giants and pixies, humans and dragons, where a skeletal beast or a demon prince could simply live and let live. Order in this 
anarchy was held by Magus alone, in a city that was its own country, a land of continual wonder and riches named Tarajah. No mage king, no rampaging army or fiend could threaten the place. It is said by the followers of Magus that the great Apocalypse King himself was slain by Magus the second Bane dared scry the great city, and that the Gods themselves feared to interfere in the city proper. Magus was known as the God Slayer even then. When the Goddess of Magic determined that magic had grown out of hand, and resolved to restrict it to the chosen people of Jarallan, it was Magus who dared to defy her. In the violent confrontation that resulted, Magus proved to be Ale’vandra’s equal….or at least nearly so. Tarajah was reduced from a green paradise to a wasteland, and the elven World Tree and much of the high elf homeland was burned to ash. Magus and Ale’vandra were absent from the prime dominion for generations, and magic no longer answered the call of mortals. It was assumed that both had been destroyed, and magic had been lost from the world. But Ale’vandra did return….as did Magus. And so did arcane power. It was assumed that the two had come to some compromise in exchange for
peace between them, or that one had been forced upon them by the other Gods. Other conspiracies claim that one god destroyed the other, and simply chose to continue to pretend the other lived so to inherit the worship of the masses.
