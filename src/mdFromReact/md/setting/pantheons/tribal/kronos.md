# Kronos - God of Adventure

<!-- toc -->

## Titles

God of Time, God of Adventure, The Wanderer, God of Passion

## Ethos

Unlike many gods, who exhort their followers to live a righteous (or unrighteous) life on while alive to reap the benefits of obedience in the afterlife, priests of Kronos preach the acquisition of divine happiness while still on being a part of the mortal coil. Many preach that ones station or happiness in life will be what carries one through a long eternity.

## Worship

Followers of Kronos carry out this philosophy in very different ways. Some followers of Kronos live life to the fullest by eating the finest foods, drinking the finest wines, and attempting to seduce the most beautiful people they can find, living a life of pleasures and enjoyment to carry them through the long eternity. Others live a life of thrill-seeking adventure. Whatever their particular method of following this ethos, the followers of Kronos strive to make each moment matter. 

Some members of Kronos’ priesthood seem to have mastered the flow of time itself, leading to his secondary designation. These chronomancers seem to be able to slow, speed up, or even reverse the flow of time. Most members of his priesthood, however, simply preach that every moment is precious and must be spent well. For this reason, while they certainly may seem to be living well, a follower of Kronos is rarely carefree, since it is through carelessness that time and therefore life, is wasted. Priests of Kronos are very driven, for this reason, to accomplish a lot in a short period of time.

## History

Kronos is considered a Created God, since there is not a historical reference for his life. He is considered the patron god of the rakasha people, but it is not known or agreed upon that he himself is a rakasha. Many people worship him, from gourmands to battle hardened mercenaries. He is generally considered a neutral god, since there a few limits placed on his worshippers, and though evil acts are not smiled upon, many of them are not expressly forbidden. Some scholars believe that he is another face or incarnation of Loki, since aspects of their religion seem similar, but there are enough differences in individual doctrines to give most scholars hesitation to make such a claim. Other’s claim he is an incarnation of Magus, since the mage kings city boasted many such time twisting tricks that have little been seen since except in the halls of Kronos’ faithful.
