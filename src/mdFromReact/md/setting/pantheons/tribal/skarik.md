## Titles

God of Vengeance, God of War, Blood God, The Blood Brother

## Ethos

The wrathful God of Vengeance heads a brutal and bloody religion based around combat. Skarik is the God called upon by nomadic and 
savage barbarian tribes, bloodthirsty warriors and templars, and vengeful souls that cry out for the blood of their enemy.

Unlike some other war Gods, Skarik does not see war as a way to preserve or further civilization. The act of war is reward in and of 
itself, and the followers of Skarik relish battle and bloodshed for just that reason.

Skarik is famous for being particularly brutal in warfare. His warriors and followers show no mercy and no quarter, believing that such 
actions are weaknesses on the battlefield. Notions of honor and chivalry are also considered misguided, the actions of the weak or 
faint-hearted. The priests of Skarik are proud of their brutality, considering it a sign of strength. Fanatical followers of Skarik often 
engage in unnecessary conflict just to demonstrate their ruthless tactics and curry favor with their bloodthirsty god.

## Worship

Clerics of Skarik are obsessed with battle, both the act itself and prowess on the field of battle. Their temples and shrines are often 
little more than challenge rings and training grounds, where the faithful showcase and practice their fighting skills. It is common for 
warriors of Skarik to keep tokens of victories, most common being a warrior ring, a band of metal forged from the possessions of an 
enemy bested in battle. Such rings may band the hands or hair of the worshipper, or just be sewn to the armor. A warrior with many rings is 
a great warrior, who has struck down many foes – or he is a foolish liar, for nothing whets the bloodlust of other warriors of Skarik than
the opportunity to prove themselves mightier than a strong warrior.

## History

Skarik himself is of unknown origin. He is probably an immortal God who has siphoned away the more brutal followers of Tyr as that god shed its malicious followers and faithful. Many human followers of Skarik believe he is the original God of War, and Tyr is the usurper who attempted to steal the God’s power. Needless to say, the priests of Tyr and Skarik hate each other fiercely. The other faction that claims Skarik as their own most vehemently is the orcs. The orcs have often claimed that Skarik is an orcish god, and worship him as such. However, others have claimed the War
God as their own, including many of the monstrous races, as well as some renegade clans of dwarves and a number of tribal peoples as well.
