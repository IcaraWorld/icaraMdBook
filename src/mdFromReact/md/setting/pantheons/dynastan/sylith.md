# Sylith - God of Conquest

## Titles

God of Conquest, God of War, The Bladed Wyrm, The Scaled Emperor

## Ethos

A Dynastan god of great influence, Sylith exhorts his followers to conquer and subjugate the world of Icara. It was under the influence of the mortal Sylith that the Dynastan armies that had long served only as a shield for the short-lived empire were forged into a far-reaching and hungry sword.

Sylith's followers worship him as a god of war. Like Draken, the worship of Sylith is less formalized that most religion, though Sylith does have large towers dedicated to his worship in the form of mastery and control. His true believers are fanatical swordmasters that live to battle, ever pushing themselves to greater and greater heights until they inevitably fall in batter. His worshippers believe that, even in the afterlife, Sylith is gathering an army and that your skill and prowess when you die will determine your place in that heavenly host of warriors. The prophets of his church foretell a second coming of Sylith, when he will lead this reborn army across Icara, destroying all who oppose him. Other religions are, justifiably, none too thrilled by the apocalypse scenario threatening their faiths, and Sylith is not often worshipped in conjunction with non-Dynastan gods.

## Worship

Sylith's teaching go beyond war itself, also preaching the justification and purpose behind the war. His worshippers preach that strength of arms is the only truth of the world, and that moral or idealistic differences are best settled on the field of battle, where the "correct" ideals are those of the victor. A war fought in Sylith's name is a war of subjugation and plunder, a war to enrich the victors and exterminate the "evil" ideals of the defeated. The Bladed Wyrm doesn't believe in relinquishing the upper hand once a battle is won, and tribute is demanded of those deemed unworthy on the field of combat, a tribute of blood or coin.

For this reason, beyond the fanatic faithful, Sylith is also worshipped by bandits and highwaymen, who justify their own pillage and plunder with Sylith's "Might is Right" philosophy, further tarnishing the civilized world's view even from beyond the Dynastan jungle.

## History

Sylith was a central figure of the Fifth Age. The direct descendant of the mighty Draken, Sylith rallied the Dynastan people into a bloodthirsty frenzy. Enslaving dozens of jungle-dwelling races, they marched forth upon the civilized lands of man. The southern kingdoms were dismissive of the Dynastans as just another horde of monsters, such as the orc or ogres armies that had long been held at bay by the advanced weaponry and tactics of humans, dwarves, and elves. The conquered that managed to survive as slaves quickly learned to appreciate the difference between a Dynastan army and monstrous horde. Sylith was merciless in his tactics, and treated humans and dwarves with no more deference than they had given orcs or goblins. Over the thirty year campaign that Sylith led, millions died at the hands of the Dynastan war machine, and many of the southern lands were returned to nature as they were purged of a population. Those that remained served as staging points for the ever-expanding invasion of the north.

By the time Sylith led his into the northern kingdoms that ringed the southern reaches of the Tarajahan desert, the poor souls within those lands had stockpiled supplies, fortified their defenses, and prepared for a siege as their please of aid from neighboring kingdoms, both great and small, had apparently been ignored. However, an unexpected answer to their pleas came as the Dynastan stood upon their doorstep in the form of a storm the like of which had never been seen, and has never been seen since. Sleet, blizzard, and deathly cold descended upon the land for weeks. The blistering, unnatural cold froze many in their bed, killing animals even in hibernation. The decimation of the unprepared Dynastan army was near absolute, with only Sylith and a few of his more stalwart companions surviving. Though the Emperor may have been able to retreat and regroup, or even raise another army, Sylith became unhinged at the deaths of his beloved armies, and charged the battlements of the besiege kingdom alone. In his suicidal wrath, he struck down many humans, dying with hands drenched in blood. The few Dynastan that survived say that, upon his death, a column of flame shot down from the heavens, immolating him and a huge section of the kingdom's castle.

The Ascension of Sylith did little to give him temperance, wisdom, or patience. The Dynastan were drive to war still, by divine prophecy of the fallen Emperor, but the succession of Sylith was brutal, his throne sought by too many as noble houses that claimed the blood of Draken blessed their lineage. By the time the Dynastan army returned to those kingdoms against which their tide had broken, they found themselves facing an army of legions, calls for aid no longer going unanswered. Even with the blessings of their newly ascended God of War, the Dynastans were defeated and slowly driven back through decades of their invasion, deep into the southern jungles until they had to consider a truce or fear for the very foundation of their empire. And so a century removed from fhe Dynastan's emergence into the kingdoms of men, the last vestige of the Scaled Emperor's vision was put to rest with the stroke of a quill.
