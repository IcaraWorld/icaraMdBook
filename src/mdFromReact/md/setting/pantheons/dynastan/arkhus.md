## Ethos

Arkhus was one of the ancient dragons, birthed at the dawn of time, son of Bahuamut. He determined that there is no reason he should not have the godly powers of his forbear, and used his research into magic, divinity, and the religions of lesser races to give himself immense amounts of power. He was busy creating his own race of worshippers to rule over when the Age of Apocalypse came upon the world, and he escalated his designs.

In the end, he was destroyed by his own creations, with the assistance of sun elves.
