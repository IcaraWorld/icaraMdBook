# Draken - Patron God of Dynastan

## Titles

Patron God of the Dynastan, God of Strength, Chain Breaker, God of Freedom

## Ethos

Despite his appearance, which in itself would strike many unaware adventurers as a statue or idol to a demon, Draken is a good god. He espouses protection of the weak by the strong, unity in all things, and strength in the face of adversity. Draken also preaches order and civilization, and tasks his followers in preserving both.

## Worship

Draken has little in the way of formal worship. He is spoken of with respect, and his insignia or likeness graces many informal family chapels and shrines within the Dynastan Empire. While many Dynastan pray to Draken, without a formal church there is little in the way of organized direction for his worshippers.

Draken extends himself as a presence, if at all, and there is no recorded history of him appearing as an avatar. Since the Dynastan themselves seem to view Draken much as a revered prophet, scholars tend to do the same. However, his godhood appears to be a given for the Dynastan people, who think of him as a messiah.

## History

Draken is an Ascended god. His historical presence is strong even in what little was recorded by the Dynastan people during their early history. He brought all Dynastan together beneath him, and along with Tyranus established the structure of society that still exists to this day. He guided his people through many severe threats to the Dynastan, from rival civilizations to near apocalyptic events, such as the mighty dracolich that threatened the young race with extinction. His deeds were the stuff of legends, and though he didn't live a long life, even as long as a normal Dynastan, what he accomplished cemented the future of the Dynastan as a power in the south. He supposedly met his death at the hands of the enemies of his people, but not even death his dedication. He continues to grant strength and guidance even from his grave.
