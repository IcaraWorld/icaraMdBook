# Gods of Icara

The ancient and mighty entities worshipped as the gods of Icara take many forms, but share some defined traits depending on their nature. Gods are often defined or categorized by theologians in the following groups:

## Elder Gods

Elder gods have been around for all of recorded history, and are often part of the origin story of Icara itself. Elder gods typically are considered to inextricably tied to Icara itself - the best example these are the elemental gods or the patron gods of the Elder races. Elder gods do not grant an "afterlife" or have a home realm to gather their faithful into. The souls of the servants of the Elders often disappear and cannot be called again after the mortal's death.

## Immortal Gods

Immortal gods are from the Outer or Eternal Realms. These gods exist separately from Icara, which is just another battleground for their ideals and worship. They seem to gather power and might from the active worship of their followers, and often grant power to their faithful in return. The followers of the Immortals within the Eternal Realms are typically granted an eternal home in the afterlife, for good or ill. 

## Ascended Gods

Ascended gods were powerful mortals that ascended into godhood, often definable historical figures, with a few notable exceptions from pre-recorded history. While it is unknown what catalyzes an Ascension, many times throughout history it has been accompanied by a major war, tragedy, or other history-shaping event. Ascended gods tend to exist within their own realm, created or conquered during their Ascension. They may also exist within a Fae dominion or within the Eternal planes. Typically, they have power within this dominion but are not often seen outside of it. The followers of Ascended gods may or may not have an afterlife.

## Patrons - Minor Gods or Demigods

Patrons are powerful beings that aren't quite gods or goddesses in their own right, but have significant power and often grant boons to mortals in exchange for their worship or a favor. These can include powerful angels, devils, or demons, as well as high fae or old dragons.


# Pantheons of the Gods
#TODO (FILL OUT THE PANTHEON SUMMARIES)

Gods or goddesses within a pantheon are understood to be closely tied to a certain people, and are often primarily worshipped by that people. A god identified as a "Patron God" of a people is believed to have either created that people or to be primarily concerned with their welfare. Other gods or goddesses of that pantheon tend to have definable relationships with the patron god, either as an acolyte or adversary - but all gods or goddesses included within a pantheon are shepherds for their people.

## Dwarven Pantheon

The dwarven gods are a relatively unchanging, ancient lot. Dwarves worship their Patron God, Odin, an elder god of great power. They also are protected by mighty dwarven heroes who have Ascended. 

## Dynastan Pantheon

The Dynastan are protected by the great heroes of their race, and call upon them for guidance when needed. The Dynastan Pantheon is fairly unique in that all of their gods were mortals who Ascended.

## Elemental Pantheon

The elemental forces are elder gods. They have been present since the beginning of recorded history, and are worshipped by many different cultures under many different names. Their true ethos and goals are a mystery, as is whether they actually need or desire the many worshippers that have flocked to them. The elemental forces respond to power more than they respond to piety, and are called upon in all walks of life. They do not involve themselves in the petty struggle for power and worshippers that other gods do, which some say shows they are true gods and others claim shows they are simply a force, not a true entity, and prayers in their names are meaningless.

The gods and goddesses of the elemental pantheon tend to draw worshippers of all cultures and peoples. Elementals grant boons, but if they speak directly to their faithful, that's between them. Often, those who worship the primal forces that form the foundation of Icara are left to divine their own magical purposes. Other worshippers accept the words of the fae most closely tied to the elemental dominion that they serve as the words of their masters.

## Eternal Pantheon

The Eternal Pantheon includes the Pantheons of the Heavens and the Hells, which contain the gods, devils, and demons who wage war over the souls of mortal men and women in Icara.

## Human Pantheon

The humans worship a wide range of gods and goddesses, from the Old Primal Gods to those that Ascended to stand at the side of the Eternals. There are  


## Moon Elf Pantheon



## Orc Pantheon



## Sun Elf Pantheon



## Tribal Pantheon

Gods without a pantheon are worshipped by a wide variety of peoples that do not seem to show favor to any, or those claimed by multiple races. Alternately, they can be entities about which there is a either conflicting or misleading information, and scholars are unable to determine the true intentions of the god or goddess.
